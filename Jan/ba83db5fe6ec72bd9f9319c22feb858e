Members of the heritage council visited the area to asses the fire damage. “During the course of our site inspection, we noted that in general many of the structures which have been burnt down could be restored. Contrary to reports that are out in the public realm, demolition is not the only option,” said Dr Mxolisi Diamuka, chief executive of Heritage Western Cape. Diamuka said the general consensus of the residents who attended the meeting with the council was that their wish was for their cottages, which have been passed on for generations, to be restored and not demolished. The Moravian Mission Station sustained more than R20 million in damages. The fire destroyed 53 homes and eight buildings. South African chairperson of Remgro, Johann Rupert has offered his assistance to residents. “We are offering assistance with regards to restoring the heritage of the area. We are arranging an assessment tomorrow (Tuesday) so that we can get a indication of the costs,” said Pieter Kotze chief executive of Historical Homes of SA, speaking on behalf of Rupert. Reverend Martin Abrahams, vice-president of the Moravian Church of Southern Africa, said: “There are still ongoing discussions with Rupert. We are going to actively be involved in the process.” marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
