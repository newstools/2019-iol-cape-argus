Higher Education and Training Minister Naledi Pandor said all prospective students wishing to study at private higher education institutions (PHEIs) needed to ensure the institution was operating legally and was accredited. The department was expecting an increase in advertising from fake institutions now that matric results were out. Pandor said while PHEIs operating legally played an important role and offered quality programmes, there were a number of “bogus” institutions that continued to advertise unregistered and unaccredited programmes. She said it was important to check the programme you wished to register for at a legally registered PHEI was accredited by the Council on Higher Education. United Association of SA spokesperson Stanford Mazhindu said thousands of rand were lost every year to fraudulent institutions that took advantage of the limited space at universities and other tertiary institutions and the many prospective applicants who couldn’t be accommodated. “Private institutions are often the next step, but not all of them are operating within the law,” he said “Parents and students must do careful research into the available options before applying to any institution.” Mazhindu said “fly-by-night” institutions that were not registered with the DHET that supplied students with invalid qualifications were on the rise. He said before one applied for admission at any institution, one should ensure that it was registered with the DHET. “The simplest way would be to ask the institution to provide you with a registration certificate. The registration certificate, which is issued by the DHET, must reflect the name of the institution, programmes offered and the registration period. A government logo and registration number are not enough,” Mazhindu said. The register is available for inspection on the department’s website: www.dhet.gov.za. sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
