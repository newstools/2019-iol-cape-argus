On Tuesday, the Muslim Judicial Council met the Reverend Godfrey Cunningham, the president of the Moravian Church in Southern Africa, and said it was committed to assisting the Wupperthal fire disaster victims. “The Moravian Church is appreciative of the pledge by the Muslim faith community, together with many other religious denominations in the country, in the call to aid the Wupperthal fire victims,” said Wilfred Solomons Johannes, spokesperson. The Moravian Mission Station sustained more than R20 million in damages after the building was destroyed by the fire. Demolition was under way and the area was closed from Monday as preparations began to demolish sections of the mission severely damage. The fire destroyed 53 homes and eight buildings. Municipal manager of Cederberg Municipality Louis Volschenk said: “The most immediate priority is to ensure the safety of the people of Wupperthal and to assist them to recover from this devastating fire. “There are no quick-fixes to this very unfortunate situation, and it is important that any and all interventions are done in a manner that is supportive of the people of Wupperthal, and that we operate within the frameworks of the relevant legislation.” marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
