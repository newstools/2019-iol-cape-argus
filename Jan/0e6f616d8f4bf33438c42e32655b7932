These were the words of Mark Fairbairn, principal at Spine Road High School in Mitchells Plain, to describe Grade 11 pupil Tameka Stephanus who has taken ballet scene by storm. The 16-year-old has won several contests and received two awards at the last SA Ballet Competition. “She received another prize; two weeks of professional training at the National School of Arts in Joburg. But they are only covering her lessons to prepare her to take part in the next SA Ballet Competition. We do not have the money for her travel, transport or accommodation. I do casual work and I’m the family’s breadwinner,” the teenager’s mother Amy Stephanus said on Thursday. “The priority is to book a flight. Tameka will be devastated to miss this opportunity.” * Anyone prepared to assist, can contact the school at 0213929463. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
