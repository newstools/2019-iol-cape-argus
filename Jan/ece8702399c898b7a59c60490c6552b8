Community Policing Forums (CPF) for these areas are worried about an increase in reports of Avanza vehicles being used in such crimes. Nyanga CPF chairperson, Martin Makasi said: “Since the first week of January we have been receiving complaints on Avanza vehicles linked to crime. Residents are crying for help.” He said registration numbers of the vehicles were often removed. Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said: “In Nyanga there were incidents reported where Avanzas were used in house robberies, hijackings of delivery trucks and sometimes cases of rape and robberies opened by passengers. Some suspects had been arrested,” he said. Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association (Cata) chairperson, Victor Wiwi said: “Unless one has a vehicle registration number it becomes a challenge to confirm who the owner of the vehicle is and whether it is a taxi. “Avanza taxis have stickers with a number on the rear and windscreen, but the stickers are removable. “We are working with the police and other stakeholders to get permanent markers that can be placed on the taxi that can be seen by the public and is irremovable. “This would mean that if a taxi is identified and is linked to a crime they can report it to police and at the Nyanga taxi rank,” he said. Police have urged residents to check registration numbers and description of drivers and not to travel late a night. zodidi.dano@inl.co.za Cape Argus
