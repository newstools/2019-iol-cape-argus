Deputy Home Affairs Minister Fatima Chohan on Tuesday said some South African parents registered their children only when they needed documents to enter primary schools. However, by law, parents are obliged to register their children within 30 days of birth. Chohan and Western Cape Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo were at Tygerberg Hospital yesterday to visit mothers who had given birth to the first babies of the new year. Tygerberg’s acting chief executive, Paul Ciapparelli, said at least 7500 babies were born annually at their facility. Only two babies were born at Tygerberg on January 1, while a pair of twins was stillborn. Thirty-three births were recorded across the Western Cape on News Year's day.

At Tygerberg, Elsies River mom Leazel Sampson gave birth to Leah at 1.40am. She has two older sons, aged 6 and 11. “I’m excited because this is my first girl,” she said. “Leah is registered. It’s easier when Home Affairs people are here. Now I don’t have to travel to their office, like I did before.” Zintle Mtshaza was still resting in a hospital bed after having given birth to Liqhawe at 2.42am. Ciapparelli said almost 50% of the births at their hospital were done by caesarean section. Chohan said: “A lot of that is because we have very young mothers. Teenagers are giving birth. We are trying to get girls to stay in school and understand that education is important.” yazeed.kamaldien@inl.co.za Cape Argus
