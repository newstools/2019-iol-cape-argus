The visit comes a day after the start of the academic year. Plato said at the library: “This week sees thousands of Grade 1 learners going through their school gates for the first time.” “I want to make sure they know about the amazing services that are available to them at our libraries, and that they use the libraries to improve their knowledge and get good grades.” “In 12 years’ time I want to see more learners who I see here today, walk through the gates of a university or a college and continue on their journey towards securing a better future.” Plato said the City of Cape Town has 104 libraries. “I want to encourage parents and older brothers and sisters to please support our children in making use of these libraries.” Libraries complement the work done at schools and tertiary institutions, and for many young people, it’s the only quiet or safe space to study. Badroodien said for many learners, the situation in their homes or neighbourhood are not conducive to study. They may experience challenges such as access to online study material. “There are areas where the library is not only the safest space, but also the one place where it is quiet enough to allow for study and knowledge retention,” he said. In most libraries students have online access to encyclopedia Britannica and Press Reader.   This includes access to the latest research and information as well as the world’s best magazines and newspapers. Badroodien said learners and students have access to factually sound information, updated on a regular basis, which will be available to them at any time of day. He said content on the site is tailored according to the educational level of the user. The service also supports those with English as a second or third language. sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
