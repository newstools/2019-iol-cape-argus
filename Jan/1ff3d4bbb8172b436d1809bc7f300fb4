"It was kept wet on the beach in an effort to save the dolphin. The dolphin was then loaded onto a sea rescue vessel whereafter it was transported to 3km out to sea, where it was released. We are confident that the dolphin will survive. It swam off strongly, and there's every confidence that this dolphin will survive its ordeal," he said.  It remained unknown what caused the dolphin to beach, and the members of the public who assisted on the scene have been commended for their efforts on the beach, Lambinon said. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
