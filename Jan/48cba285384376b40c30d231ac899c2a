The R44 Clarence Drive between Rooi Els and Gordon’s Bay remained closed to traffic for the third day on Tuesday as the blaze spread along its upper slopes. “No property is in danger and no injuries have been reported. Fire was monitored through the night, still contained within the Steenbras Dan area,” said the City’s fire and rescue spokesperson, Theo Layne. "Fire crews will remain on scene throughout the day." Meanwhile, 1200 firefighters from the Working on Fire (WoF) programme of the Department of Environmental Affairs remain on high alert to help fight veld and forest fires across the province. The 2018/19 Summer Fire Season officially started in December last year and normally continues until the end of April. WoF in the province has more than 700 firefighters stationed at 27 bases. “Five hundred more firefighters stationed across the country have been placed on national standby to provide relief and assistance where needed,” said WoF spokesperson Lauren Howard. James-Brent Styan, spokesperson for Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell, has cautioned the public against spreading fake news on social media. On Wednesday, a voice note on WhatsApp was doing the rounds about a fire that broke out in Dutoitskloof in the Western Cape. The voice note states that the N1 is closed and “people can be seen setting fires”. “We want to urge people to please stop spreading fake news, it causes unnecessary panic especially in a time when the province is dealing with real fires. I urge the public, if they are concerned about something, to please contact the authorities,” Styan said. On Sunday, the City said that the Kogel Bay resort was being evacuated to ensure the safety of campers there. It said the entire picnic area had been burnt and the infrastructure at the park destroyed. According to the Greater Overberg Fire Protection Association, the fire is 80% contained; 8270ha were affected. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
