Yanga Lingani, Yonela Kitise, Lovo Khwehla and Lwando Lese came together on Monday evening to exhibit their impressive and emotive artwork at 6 Spin Street in the city centre. Members of the public are invited to come and share this educational experience with the artists. The artists all grew up with various challenges in Khayelitsha and they have chosen art as a platform to help address the issues of violence, abuse, inequality and other social injustices. The artwork is also a way for the youths to focus on being creative rather than engaging in destructive behaviour. “I spend most of my time with my artwork, you have to be creative and plan. I want to help people with my art and send a positive message through it. My artwork focuses on children growing up in the household because that is where the issues begin and it is also where we find our future leaders,” said Lingani. The exhibition involved individuals discussing important issues in society such as the challenges the youth are facing in society, how the youth can get involved with fighting for change and how art can be used to uplift the youth. Some attendees read poetry and there were also live performances by young creatives. “I want the viewers of my work to have hope through my work. I want other young people to know that it is possible,” said Kitise. Khwehla said: “Khayelitsha is a place surrounded by many social issues and as a young person I didn’t want to get influenced by it. I started drinking in Grade 9 and struggled with stopping. I had to focus on something else and I chose art.” The exhibition will continue for the next few weeks. Entrance is free. sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za Cape Argus
