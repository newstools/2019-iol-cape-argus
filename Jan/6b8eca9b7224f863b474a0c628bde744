The judgment was delivered by Judge Nape Dolamo on December 14 last year at the Equality Court. It followed an application filed by the SJC, the Nyanga Community Policing Forum and Equal Education. Judge Dolamo said: “The allocation of police human resources in the Western Cape unfairly discriminates against black and poor people on the basis of race and poverty; and the system employed by the SAPS to determine the allocation of police human resources, in so far as it has been shown to be the case in the Western Cape province, unfairly discriminates against black and poor people on the basis of race and poverty.” The SJC said: “The judgment delivered is a victory for poor, black communities confronted by high rates of contact and violent crime. The judgment holds massive promise for poor people, as the ruling declared poverty as an unlisted ground of unfair discrimination.” The SJC said that by appealing against the declarations, the state would only delay the equitable delivery of services to poor, black people. “Communities rendered most vulnerable by poverty and crime will be left in life-threatening situations because the SAPS continues, again, to ignore and undermine the findings of other organs of state and constitutionally mandated bodies. This is unconscionable,” said the SJC. The organisation further added that the State’s appeal of the judgment not only undermined this recommendation, but ultimately undermined the constitutional imperative of civilian oversight of the police service. Police spokesperson Vish Naidoo confirmed the declaration would be appealed. “The documents were submitted on January 10, we are unable to divulge what the basis of the appeal is to the media,” he said. zodidi.dano@inl.co.za Cape Argus
