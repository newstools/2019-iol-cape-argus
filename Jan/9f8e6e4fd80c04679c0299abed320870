Cape Town - The South African National Roads Agency SOC Limited (SANRAL) would like to inform the public of scheduled road closure on the R300 towards Paarl, at the Stellenberg Interchange between 17 and 25 January 2019. Contractors need to commence with the remedial work on bridge B5594, which involves raising the bridge decks to replace the bearings on top of the piers and abutments. No traffic loading can be endured during the jacking operations. This will require both a partial and full closure as follows: Shoulder closure at the R300 bridge, from 22h00 on Thursday 17 January 2019 until 17h00 on Friday 25 January 2019. A full road closure will be done at the R 300 bridge (towards Paarl) on Friday 18 January 2019 from 00h00 until 04h00. “We will endeavour to complete the work and open the road as quickly as possible, and we appeal to the public to be patient during this process. SANRAL apologises for the inconvenience caused to road users,” said Randall Cable, SANRAL’s Western Region Manager. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
