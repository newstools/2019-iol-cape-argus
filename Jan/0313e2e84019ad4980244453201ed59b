The City missed its June deadline to present its plan. Community leader Tshepo Moletsana said: “We have not received any plans from anyone. We were supposed to have a public meeting with Brett Herron and the mayor Patricia De Lille, but because of the restructuring in the City, there have been massive delays.” He said the only communication he had received was that the City had appointed a consultant to look into the development. In December 2017, community leaders, with Patricia de Lille, signed a settlement agreement supervised by the office of the Public Protector. It was agreed to draw up a framework on how the area would be developed. Meanwhile, the residents want the City to make a piece of land available to them in Masiphumelele to serve as an emergency relocation. The project was meant to be handled by the former director of informal settlements, Shehaam Sims. She was given the task by the mayor in 2013, but she resigned in September 2016. Since then little has changed in the area. The City’s mayoral committee member for spatial planning and environment, Marian Nieuwoudt, said: “A draft plan has been prepared and is undergoing a process of engagements with various stakeholders. The City is first consulting the community leaders. Thereafter we will engage with the broader community. The plan will be finalised once the engagements are concluded and the council approves it. Currently, the area’s district spatial plan is the approved plan which is guiding decisions.” marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
