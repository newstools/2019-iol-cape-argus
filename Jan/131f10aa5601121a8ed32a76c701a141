February 15 is International Childhood Cancer Day. According to CHOC (Childhood Cancer Foundation), about two-thirds of children who have cancer never get to a treatment centre. If they do, it is only during the late stages of the disease. The most common cancers in children are leukaemia lymphoma, brain tumours, Wilms’ tumours and soft tissue sarcomas. For a four-year-old from Mossel Bay, however, doctors luckily detected the tumour early on. They diagnosed her with Wilms’ tumours, also known as cancer of the kidneys. Little Danelle’s mother, Johanna Manho, said they took her to hospital in August last year after she was constantly constipated. “Last year it got so bad that her stomach was swollen and hard. This was when we rushed her to the hospital. The doctors immediately did a scan of her stomach and found the tumour in her kidney. What saved her was the fact that doctors detected the tumour early in her life,” Manho said. CHOC regional manager Lynette Muthuray explained that early detection of childhood cancer affords early diagnosis, enabling a better chance of being cured and an increase in the survival rate. “International Childhood Cancer Day is a global collaborative initiative to raise awareness of childhood cancer and express support for children with cancer, survivors and their families. “In developed countries, childhood cancer has become largely curable, with the overall survival rate reaching between 70% and 80%, whereas in South Africa the rate is approximately 55%,” Muthuray said. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
