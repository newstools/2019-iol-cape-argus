Traffic and law enforcement officials were out in full force to maintain order among the chaos. Despite a number of warnings about detonating fireworks anywhere other than in designated areas, there were still incidents in which fireworks were discharged in residential areas, causing distress to pets. Cape Town mayor Dan Plato had this message for the residents: “As 2018 draws to a close, I would like to wish all the residents of and visitors to Cape Town a safe, fun and prosperous 2019. “2018 had its fair share of highlights, among which included Cape Town being awarded the Events and Festival Capital of the world, a title that will no doubt see more visitors flock to our shores and, with that increase in visitors, more job opportunities and skills development for our communities,” he said. “The staff in the City of Cape Town know what is expected of them. We will need all hands on deck, and that includes city officials as well as our residents, who I am asking to work with us, so that we can meet our targets and ensure that the people of Cape Town enjoy the most effective and efficient service delivery,” Plato said.   argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
