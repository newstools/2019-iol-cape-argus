Kamva Goso, 18, from Intsebenziswano Secondary School in Browns Farm was the top performing student in physical science and achieved seven distinctions. Goso was honoured at the 2018 Western Cape National Senior Certificate Awards Ceremony at Leeuwenhof on Thursday. “Being the fifth best learner in the province and the best learner in physical science is really a reflection of hard work and being awarded for such makes me really excited. I am also shocked because it’s not every year that you get a child from the townships receiving an award,” Goso said. “My school is a Quintile 2 and it really lacks a lot of resources. For example we don’t have a computer lab so for physical science and chemistry you can imagine the outcomes. It was really a massive challenge especially while writing exams,” Goso said. Goso also faced struggles at home. Late last year Goso’s father abandoned him and his family leaving Goso as the breadwinner. “I had to take the place of my father to my two younger siblings. I had to help my mother take care of them and try everything in my power to make sure that they survive,” he said. He said that it got tougher while he was studying for his final exams. “It was very challenging because I wanted to work and I wanted to study but I tried to maintain focus and just kept pushing on. But it was not only for me but mostly for my family.” Goso plans to study actuarial science at UCT and has encouraged pupils “to always rise above their challenges”. Goso was accepted into UCT but needs funds to assist him with accommodation and transport anyone who wants to donate can call021 467 2531. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
