Cape Town’s water crisis produced several headlines as the City and the DA struggled to get to grips with the situation and contain the political fallout. Just as we thought the army was going to have to man water stations, it rained buckets. Metrorail hogged the headlines as arson attacks on trains, vandalising of train infrastructure and crime crippled the service causing immense discomfort for commuters. The endless gang violence on the Cape Flats finally saw president Cyril Ramaphosa announcing the roll-out of the Anti Gang Unit in problem areas on the Cape Flats. The unit is set to go national. Prominent court cases saw hefty sentences for convicted murderers Henry van Breda, who killed his family with an axe, property mogul Jason Rohde, who was convicted for the murder of his wife, and the killers of Matie student Hannah Cornelius, who got life terms for her rape and murder. The issue of social housing heated up and there’s no doubt 2019 will see a push for affordable housing within the inner city intensify as activists gear up to pressurise government to release public land for housing. De Lille’s stance on moving people closer to the City was met with mass disapproval which resulted in her resignation. It’s also led to top DA councillors resigning such as former mayoral committee member for transport and urban development Brett Herron who said there was a “white cabal” within the party deliberately blocking social housing projects. Earlier in 2018, the Cape Argus reported the City owns over 44000 pieces of land in the metro and yet is unable to meet the demand for housing. The issue of social housing has also raised some moral concerns about the DA. Parents will be battling the most financially in the new year with increases in school fees on the cards.
