The blaze, which started in the foothills of mountains behind the villages in the early hours of Wednesday, crossed the R44 and has claimed the life of one person and injured three others, two seriously. “After a full day’s operations, continuously addressing numerous flare-ups with no aerial support, the wind speed increased substantially, and by evening containment was not possible and contingency plans were activated,” said a spokesperson for the Greater Overberg Fire Protection Association. “Warnings and evacuations were done throughout the early hours of this (Thursday) morning whilst firefighters brave high mountains and waves of fire,” reported The Greater Overberg Fire Protection Services. Chairperson of the standing committee on local government Masizole Mnqasela, expressed his deepest sympathies for the victims saying: “Our prayers are with the family of the deceased and the fire victims who have suffered terrible burns. We also pray for our firemen and all men in uniform, volunteers and members of the affected communities.” Masizole added that donations such as canned foodstuffs, sweets and medical supplies like earbuds and eyedrops are still needed for firefighters on scene.
