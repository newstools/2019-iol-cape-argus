Cape Town - Fed up Bonteheuwel lashed out at Police minister Bheki Cele at a public meeting on Tuesday. Residents accused the minister of disrespecting them and of failing them. “Minister we are tired of engagements and we are tired of the killings we need results. You have disrespected us as a community,” said resident Henriette Abrahams. The minister's visit comes after three people were shot and killed on Sunday in the space of 4 hours. Western Cape provincial police commissioner Khombinkosi Jula said: “The minister wants to try and understand what went on in the community following previous engagements.”   In response to the cries of the residents, Cele said he will meet with them again and hold more discussions. Bonteheuwel Ward councillor Angus McKenzie informed that Cape Argus that no local or provincial government officials were invited to the meeting with the police minister.                marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
