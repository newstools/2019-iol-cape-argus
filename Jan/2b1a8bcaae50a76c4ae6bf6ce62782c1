Thousands of holidaymakers descended on the City’s beaches to cool off from the Cape heat. While roads along the coast were congested and throngs of people could be seen soaking up the sun and frolicking in the water, there was a strong police and beach security presence, and lifeguards had their hands full monitoring beachgoers. Cele was satisfied with security measures around the beaches this festive season. He visited Monwabisi Beach, Muizenberg Beach, and Camps Bay beaches, including Clifton. Cele mentioned the reason he visited Clifton was due to the recent fracas on Fourth Beach. “I had to come especially to this beach to clarify what happened on December 23, where our people were instructed to leave while still enjoying themselves.” Cele said no one had the authority to chase anyone from a beach. He said people must enjoy the beaches but must not bring alcohol. “Alcohol will be confiscated,” Cele said, reminding everyone that beaches were alcohol-free zones. Beachgoer Nicki Keister said she was pleased with the police presence. “We at least feel safe on our beaches. We have been seeing a number of police and security guards.”      @SAPoliceService minister Bheki Cele conducting a beach walkabout in Cape Town @TheCapeArgus @IOL @AfriNewsAgency#SaferWesternCape #HappyNewYearPictures : Sisonke Mlamla pic.twitter.com/avU7rmzxS0 Beachgoers with children have been encouraged to make use of the Identikidz programme, where children are registered when they come to the beach and given wrist tags with their parents’ contact details in case they get lost. Winde accompanied the Mitchells Plain Community Policing Forum and Child Rapid Response Unit to patrol Mnandi Beach and register children as part of the Identikidz project. Winde said there were 58 volunteers from the Mitchells Plain safety sector, along with a large contingent of SAPS and metro police officers on the beach. He said he was pleased with the programme and how it was being implemented. “It is easy for beachgoers to identify the volunteers, with their reflector jackets, on the beaches.”   sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
