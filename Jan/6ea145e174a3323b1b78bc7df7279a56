Cape Town - The devastating fire that occurred on Sunday 30 December 2018 was unexpected that caused large-scale devastation and destruction in the picturesque Moravian Mission Station in Wupperthal. The catastrophic inferno destroyed nearly 60 homes and left over 200 persons homeless following the tragic event. The Moravian Church of Southern Africa following this tragic event is putting plans in place to strengthen the capability of the church and in particular the Wupperthal Moravian Mission Station, that is located remotely within the mountainous terrain far removed from other towns and infrastructure, to prepare for and respond to disasters. A building has been made available by church to establish a local disaster management centre to place Wupperthal on state of preparedness and to effectively respond with emergency situations and when disasters incidents occurs. The building was previously used a glove factory that exported leather from the Wupperthal mission station. The building will be used as an emergency command and control centre to interact with authorities from the mission station. It will also serve as a skills development centre and where social development work will be implemented to upskill local people. The church following this event is putting in place contingency measures and disaster preparedness arrangements to be on state of emergency preparedness should any unforeseen incident occurs in the future.
