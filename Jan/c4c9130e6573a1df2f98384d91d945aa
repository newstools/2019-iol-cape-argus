Cape Town - The MSC Musica luxury cruise ship was set to enter Cape Town harbour on Thursday afternoon, but due to unexpected strong wind conditions, the ship is now set to enter Cape Town Harbour in the early hours of Saturday morning. The MSC Musica is the first Musica-class cruise ship that was built in 2006 and is operated by MSC Cruises. The ship has 12 passenger decks and 1,275 staterooms which can accommodate 2,550 passengers double occupancy, served by approximately 990 crew members. A passenger on the ship informed the Cape Argus that the cruise ship was coming from Walvis Bay. It was expected to leave Cape Town on Friday, stop in Port Elizabeth, before docking again in Durban on January 28. Early on Friday morning, the Captain of the MSC Musica refused to lift anchor until the wind drops and after conducting a review at 10h00, decided that it would be best to dock on Saturday morning. "The latest on the MSC Musica is that the cruise ship will be coming into port at 02h00 tomorrow [Saturday] morning. This should not affect our traffic at all," said City of Cape Town Traffic Service's spokesperson, Richard Coleman. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
