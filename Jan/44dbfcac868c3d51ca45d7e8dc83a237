NSFAS spokesperson Kagisho Mamabolo said the approved number included 50000 SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) grant students. “The Scheme received more than 410000 applications by the close of applications last year with over 95% already processed,” Mamabolo said. In December, many students expressed their concerns about NSFAS application rejections which forced it to begin a review process for the rejected applications. Mamabolo said more than 65000 from the 100000 applications that were previously rejected have been reviewed and have now been approved for funding. Mamabolo said the remaining 40 000 applications were being reviewed. Following the outcry of students, SA Union of Students (SAUS) summoned the student bursary agency to an “urgent” meeting yesterday held at the OR Tambo Premier Hotel, to discuss and address the state of readiness across the sector. SAUS secretary-general Lwandile Mtsolo said the union noted there were many “dire and urgent issues around student registration and funding across universities that need to be urgently addressed”. However, Higher Education and Training Minister Naledi Pandor said NSFAS was ready to assist students as best they could. Pandor was addressing the national crisis faced by many students over tertiary education funding. “NSFAS will work closely with financial aid offices at institutions to ensure that deserving students are provided with funding decisions as soon as possible,” Pandor said. sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
