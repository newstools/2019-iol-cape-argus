“Heritage is supposed to give value and it recognises the heritage of people. “This is really within the interests only of the estate agents,” said Seeham Samaai from the Bo-Kaap Collective. She said these estate agents’ views indicate that they are not considering the heritage of the area. “They only care about one thing which is development; heritage has to be valued as well.” Last week, the Cape Argus reported that estate agents were worried about the property value of the area and that declaring it a heritage site could limit growth. Last week Friday marked the start of the public participation process into the feasibility of the proposal to declare the area a heritage site. Bo-Kaap Civic and Ratepayers’ Association vice-chairperson Fouzia Achmat said: “They should not use scare tactics. The residents who stay in Bo-Kaap are not interested in the value of the property; they are only interested in staying closer to the CBD.” In December, the City of Cape Town’s Mayoral Committee resolved to support the designation of the Bo-Kaap as a Heritage Protection Overlay Zone (HPOZ), and made the recommendation that council approve a public participation process for the proposal at its council meeting. Talks to have Bo-Kaap declared a heritage site escalated last year after residents took part in protests and barred developers from entering the area. At the heart of the matter is the issue about housing, as developers buy up property. In 2016, the process was halted and the HPOZ for the Bo-Kaap was put on hold indefinitely. In early 2018, Ward 77 councillor Brandon Golding submitted another motion to sub-council 16, requesting that the HPOZ for the Bo-Kaap be implemented with immediate effect and that reasons be given for the delay.      Man, these Jawitz cats need to realise this ain't the West Bank. Bokaap heritage is paramount, goes back to the days of Simon van der Stel and the first slaves. Jawitz clan probably only arrived in early 20th century. Tsek!      Sorry you can't profit off someone else's land or suffering because of gentrification any more. Boo hoo. Go get your commission somewhere else.      So off the mark and out of touch with their own community - oh I forgot - no real estate agent from this firm lives in Bo-Kaap - at least not the directors or seniors if any - no wonder they can talk like this - lets build hi-rises in Fresnaye & Constantia and see how they react      I don’t think I could care less about the estate agent’s feelings. Boo hoo. Maybe stop gentrifying neighbourhoods and pushing people out of their homes. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa rallied behind Bo-Kaap residents, promising last December that the government planned to make the area a “cultural destination for all”. The City’s mayco member for spatial planning, Marian Nieuwoudt, said: “We started with the process on Friday. I received many queries regarding the national government’s process and our process. I think there might be some confusion, but we will see whether we can promote the guidelines of the proposed overlay within the coming weeks.” Niewoudt said that the property value in the area might decrease. “But look, if one door opens another closes. We have earmarked that area for a great tourist attraction and that is what counts,” she said. * Additional reporting by Theolin Tembo marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
