There will be plenty of entertainment in the form of activities and street performances, and the public is also encouraged to bring their own games and sports equipment. Participants can experience the street in a completely different way to the usual peak hour rush. “We believe it can be an opportunity to engage with transport and mobility while connecting with others. We believe this day can get citizens in the right mindset to be part of that change,” said Marcela Guerrero Casas, the co-founder and managing director of Open Streets. Casas hopes that this will be the year of change in commuting patterns:“Our organisation believes in experiential learning. Jumping on a bicycle or walking along a street where people are normally stuck in traffic can result in a positive experience that translates into new transport habits. The Open Streets experience makes it easy to imagine the benefits of a society with less car use, such as increased health, stronger and safer communities, and a healthier environment. “I think this initiative is great because it allows people to get together and enjoy Cape Town in a different way,” said Alex Molsen, managing director of Dapper Coffee Co in Bree Street. “They can also experience Bree Street and see what it’s like on foot because you get to see things that you don’t usually see while driving. It’s quite cool.” sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za Cape Argus
