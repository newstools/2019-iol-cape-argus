SACE made the decision in March last year that all people applying for registration with SACE need to produce a police clearance certificate that is not older than six months. The spokesperson for SACE, Themba Ndhlovu, said: “The rationale behind this progressive decision is that the council wants to assure the public that registered teachers are beyond reproach. The council and its stakeholders believe in the protection of the integrity and standing of the profession. “Only cases of a serious nature, which may include murder and robbery, among other sexual cases, will be treated seriously and may have an implication of denying such individuals admission to the profession. The above is not conclusive. However, each case will be looked at individually.” But the DA has raised concerns. DA member of the portfolio committee on basic education, Sonja Boshoff, said: “The question is, what about the incumbent teachers who have a history with crimes? Why does this not apply to them? Every teacher should be subjected to an SAPS clearance certificate.” Last year, Boshoff laid criminal charges against the chief executive of SACE, its chairperson and other SACE board members for not adequately vetting teachers in terms of section 47 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
