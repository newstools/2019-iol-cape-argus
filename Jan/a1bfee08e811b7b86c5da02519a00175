Cape Town – An inquest docket has been opened for investigation into the death of an unidentified man who was electrocuted atop a train yesterday morning. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said the man, believed to be in his thirties, was found on top of the train at about 5.30am yesterday. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said the matter was being investigated. “We received confirmation of an electrocution atop a train at Philippi station early morning. It was the first train of the day and it is unclear what led to the incident. “Emergency services, the police, Metrorail crews, forensics and mortuary van (responded to) the scene. SAPS closed the line for the duration of their on-site investigation,” Scott said. According to Scott, the incident had a significant impact on operations. “The operational impact of the incident (resulted in) Chris Hani trains being forced to terminate at Philippi until the line is declared safe for operations. "Commuters (were) advised to find alternative transport between Chris Hani to Philippi as bus operators (were) unable to assist during peak,” Scott said. This incident comes after the illegal invasion and erection of structures along the Philippi railway line on Tuesday. The City said they have offered their assistance to the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) to enhance the safety of residents after a Philippi land invasion The engagement stems from the City’s concerns about the safety of the community and residents who have illegally occupied this Prasa-owned land.
