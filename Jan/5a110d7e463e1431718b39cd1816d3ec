DA Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela said the early numbers looked good. “We are definitely going to secure ward 31 (parts of Bonteheuwel and Valhalla Park). “There are very positive developments in ward 5 in the Bergrivier numbers look good. In ward 101 in Kraaifontein it will be an uphill battle, but we are fighting” he said. ANC elections head Ebrahim Rasool said they had contracted buses to transport voters to polling booths. “We have targeted the rush-hour peak. Most people come home by then and we can then get them to vote. “So far, the numbers are looking good and the reports that have come in from our volunteers in all three contested wards have been very positive,” he said. The three ward by-elections are being contested by 12 candidates. In Ward 31 in the City, the candidates are Charmaine Sarah Marion Malgas from the ACDP, Bazoya Vuyolwetu Mtini (ANC), Theresa Bereniece Thompson (DA), Kenneth David Brookes (Democratic Independent Party) and Theresa Jafta (EFF). In ward 101 in Bloekombos, Siyabonga Solly Duka is standing for the ANC, Siseko Mbandezi for the DA and Lucky Nyameko Valela for the EFF. In ward 5 in the Bergrivier Municipality, the contenders are Andries Jaars, an independent, Jan Maarman (ACDP), Immanuel Adams (ANC), Adam Andreas van Wyk (DA) and Dirk Jakobus Adams (EFF). DA metro chairperson Grant Twigg said the party had laid charges against the ACDP for allegedly distributing food vouchers for votes. The ACDP did not respond to the DA’s complaints. The results of the by-elections were expected late last night. jason.felix Cape Argus
