The society said over the December period it had sterilised 243 cats and dogs, vaccinated 621 dogs and 185 cats, admitted 375 animals into their hospital and conducted 1947 consultations. Their inspectorate was equally busy and attended to 106 reports of animal cruelty. “We are proud of our non-selective admissions policy and the fact that we never turn any animal in need away. But helping so many animals, many of which were strays or belong to indigent owners, ended up hurting us financially,” said Allan Perrins, a spokesperson. Perrins said its costs doubled over December and although there was an uptick in income it was nowhere near what the society invested. “Our kennels were and are still full to capacity with unclaimed stray animals and adorable adoption hopefuls. “The staff to animal ratio was incredibly challenging over the festive period yet no one complained and everyone got stuck in. “None of the operational staff took a break and it was humbling to see them as always willingly going the extra mile.” But it was funding that was the biggest challenge for the society as they received no financial aid from the government or Lotto. “Funding is always a major preoccupation for any welfare organisation, and the fact that we managed to cope with this influx speaks volumes about the passion and commitment of our comparatively small team. “We are entirely dependent on the goodwill and generosity of the general public and enlightened corporates, without whose help we would be unable to perform the indispensable lifesaving work we do.” Perrins is pleading for assistance. “Our operational and financial challenges are not insurmountable and together we can close the gap between income and expenditure provided that more of Cape Town’s animal lovers support us. Gifts in kind such as pet food are as welcome and as important as monetary donations; no gift is ever too small. Every bit helps.” marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
