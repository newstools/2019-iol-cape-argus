Cape Town - Life on earth is a rollercoaster ride of emotions and our reactions to these emotions. All too often, we coast through life, unaware of our behavioural choices and even worse, unable to consider the possibility that we could have made better choices for ourselves along the way. According to Founder Step Up Education Centre, Cindy Glass says: “Self-awareness is the first skill in emotional intelligence and it sets the precedent for the growth and development of all emotional intelligence skills. Being able to look at ourselves honestly, and without negative judgement, will enable and empower us to achieve greater success in all that we do. This, of course, applies to our children and their personal and academic learning as well.” She adds that self-awareness skills will help your children become aware of their emotions and behaviours and make better choices in all that they do. They will also experience better personal relationships as they become aware of the emotions, behaviours and choices of others. “It is important to note that self-awareness includes skills in being aware of positive and negative emotions, behaviours and choices. It is about learning to own these choices, learn from the mistakes and consider what behaviours will be best in any situation,” Glass explains. She offers the following helpful tips to teach your child this essential life skill:   * Adapted from a press release Cape Argus
