Cape Town - A 50-year-old community activist, who assisted many people who were evicted from their homes over the years, has been accepted at UCT to study law this year. In 2000, Ashraf Cassiem from Tafelsig, Mitchells Plain, was also evicted from his house. Soon afterwards, he started the Anti-Eviction Campaign and helped other individuals and communities to fight evictions. He said he was very excited to study this year. “It has always been my dream. This will enable me to help more people in my community. "I was accepted at UCT to study for a Bachelor of Social Science and Humanities and my major will be law. "My subjects will be philanthropy, anthropology and economics. But my real interest is law, which will be my major. We need more lawyers to help people with matters such as evictions. "I want to become a law expert in my community. Lawyers charge people exorbitant prices which our people cannot afford. “Yes, people are asking why I want to go and study at my age, but it is something I've always wanted to do and, after completing the degree, I will be able to help my community.” Cassiem added that building houses for people should be made a priority. No new rental housing is being built for the poor, he said. “I think it’s a shame that housing is still not a priority. Housing and housing delivery are still outsourced or privatised. No new rental housing is introduced for the poor. "The eviction of people from their houses should be stopped. There should also not be temporary relocation areas such as Blikkiesdorp in Delft. Evictions… only lead to more squatter camps. People have a right to decent housing and sending them to relocation camps is not a solution,” Cassiem said. He has been unable to secure a bursary to begin his studies and has appealed to the public for help. Cassiem can be contacted on 076 186 1408. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
