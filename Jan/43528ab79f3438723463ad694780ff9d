UWC Rugby team is preparing to take part in the 12th season of the Varsity Cup, kicking off against UCT’s Ikey Tigers on February 4. UWC is the first historically-disadvantaged institution to play in the Varsity Cup. Coach Chester Williams, rector and vice-chancellor Tyrone Pretorius and director of sport Mandla Gagayi have made an impassioned plea to the entire UWC community, including alumni, former rugby players and donors, to get behind Udubs as they make history. Last year, Udubs were promoted to the Varsity Cup after beating the University of Fort Hare 39-18 in the final of the Varsity Shield. Since the arrival of Williams in 2016, the UWC side has been in top form. “The players have worked very hard, not just with rugby training, but in their studies too, and they are now going to put their bodies on the line for this university.” Pretorius said: “Advancing to the Varsity Cup is proof that UWC is committed to excellence, performing at the highest levels and nurturing talent. I am very proud of the team and coaching staff and glad that their hard work has been rewarded.” Gagayi said the promotion to the Varsity Cup symbolised a great game changer and it is proof of UWC's role of giving hope to those who never had opportunities before. Since being established in 1965, UWC RFC has produced a number of players who have not only represented their province and South Africa, but have also gone on to occupy important administrative positions in rugby. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
