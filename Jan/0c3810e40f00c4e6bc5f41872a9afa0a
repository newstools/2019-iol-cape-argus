A preliminary investigation has found that the cause of the two trains colliding at the Mountain View train station on Tuesday was cable theft, which caused the signal system to start operating manually. After the crash, Transport Minister Blade Nzimande railed against security contractors who had been hired by the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) to monitor the rail system and prevent crimes like cable theft. Unite Behind spokesperson Matthew Hirsch said the state of Prasa’s rail safety was an indictment of security contractors: “We continue our call for a radical overhaul of security operations that focuses on commuter safety.” Hirsch said they had submitted the Promotion of Access to Information Act (Paia) requests to Prasa to gain access to the Prasa security contracts in the Western Cape. United National Transport Union spokesperson Sonja Carstens said there was a much “smaller likelihood” of such a collision in the Western Cape. She said the Western Cape had its own problems regarding the trains, while the use of manual authorisation in Gauteng had become the norm, which was not like the Western Cape. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said they had dealt with the re-signalling on Cape Town station. She said a R2.1 billion re-signalling project has been completed in December which also focused on upgrading of the permanent way, replacing slips and points to enable smaller headways between trains. Cape Town executive major Dan Plato said the people of Cape Town deserved a safe and reliable public transport system. “Rail should be commuters mode of choice because commuting by rail is more affordable, and it’s the most efficient mode of transport.” sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
