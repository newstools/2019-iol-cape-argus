Lawyer Mornay Calitz, appearing for Thobela Xoseni, 30, confirmed in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court that a bed had been found for his client. He added that the matter would be postponed for the duration of the observation and the compilation of a psychiatric report on Xoseni’s mental state that would be presented at his next appearance. The accused is facing charges of unlawfully and intentionally damaging essential infrastructure and destroying infrastructure relating to the incident on April 22 where trains were set alight at Cape Town station. Court papers shows that Xoseni was nabbed after CCTV footage showed him exiting one of the trains. Correspondence from the director of public prosecutions indicates that if the accused is found fit to stand trial, the matter can proceed as normal. Hendry van Reenen, a protection official employed by Prasa, said that the day after the incident he received a call from his manager summoning him to the platforms. The manager informed Van Heerden that he saw the alleged suspect on the station and that he was following him. “On my arrival at platform 18/19 I found the manager with an unknown male whom I identified as the suspect based on the CCTV footage.” vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Args
