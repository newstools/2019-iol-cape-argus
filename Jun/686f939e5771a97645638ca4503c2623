The court granted a request by residents of Schulphoek for more time to prepare their case against the eviction. Community leader Gcobani Ndzongana said they pleaded for the postponement because they were not ready to submit their documents to the lawyers. He said the eviction proceedings were brought against backyard dwellers from Zwelihle by the owners of the land, Cape Theme Parks and Cavcor. He said they had been occupying the land since March last year. “The dwellers resisted numerous attempts by the Red Ants to remove them, which resulted in unrest and protests in Hermanus,” Ndzongana said. He said the community and the land occupiers were promised Schulphoek would be used to build houses for backyarders. Tuesday’s second postponement in the case was granted after a request by the residents’ lawyer Thulasizwe Twalo. This comes after Rabcav had signed an agreement to sell the property to Cape Metropolitan Investments in May 2017 for R30 million and Rabcav had to hand over vacant land to the purchaser, hence the eviction proceedings.
