Cape Town - Today, around 250 fact checkers from around the world will arrive in Cape Town for the sixth international fact-checking summit: Global Fact 6. The annual summit is an opportunity for journalists, academics and technologists to come together as a network and exchange new insights and past experiences. But it’s also a breeding ground for ideas that can grow into tangible, large-scale projects in the years to come. This year’s conference, hosted by Poynter’s International Fact-Checking Network, will be held at UCT. When the first Global Fact-Checking Summit took place in London in 2014, the world of fact-checking was significantly smaller than it is today.  Only about 30 active fact-checking organisations dedicated to fighting fake news attended that event. The three-day fact-checking conference, which runs from tomorrow until June 21, has previously swept through London (2014 and 2015), Madrid (2016), Buenos Aires (2017) and Rome (2018). The group of more than 200 participants includes 70 people from Europe, 60 from Africa, 55 from Asia, 44 from North and Central America, 16 from South America and five from Oceania. mwangi.githahu@inl.co.za Cape Argus
