Cape Town - Subsequent to the revamp of the Station Deck minibus taxi facility earlier this year, the City of Cape Town's Transport Directorate recently decorated the area with colourful murals. Approximately 200,000 people, from commuters, to pedestrians, traders, and minibus taxi operators use the Station Deck facility in the Cape Town central business district on any given weekday. The barriers that are used to divert and direct the movement of minibus taxis within the facility are stark concrete obstacles. That is until the City proposed for artwork to turn the barriers into colourful dividers that will assist in creating a more welcoming environment for those who frequently use the area above the Cape Town train station. Construction Co painted the murals as part of the external paintwork at the facility. "After the recent refurbishment was completed, there were more jersey barriers than before and the facility looked rather dull. So, we decided to brighten the place up with vibrant artwork," the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Transport Felicity Purchase said "I’m convinced that this helps to improve the commuters’ experience within the Station Deck Precinct, and I invite those who visit the facility to next time take a closer look at what we’ve done." Purchase said the artwork is both educational and decorative in nature. "The Station Deck is one of the city’s busiest transport facilities and thousands of commuters from suburbs from all over Cape Town disembark or fetch minibus taxis from this rank," Purchase said "At this stage it is the only taxi facility with artwork, but we may consider rolling out this type or similar murals at other facilities in the future, if possible."
