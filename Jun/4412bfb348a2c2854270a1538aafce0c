Cape Town - Law enforcement officers received an anonymous tip off on Wednesday that three unknown suspects were cutting overhead wires in Bramble Way, Bonteheuwel along the railway line. Upon arrival officers found three males in the area who appeared to behave in a very suspicious manner. A thorough inspection was carried out and the officers discovered a huge amount of overhead copper wires along the railway track had been cut and some lengths were already rolled up and ready to be removed. Officers interrogated the suspects and found more copper wire hidden in the immediate vicinity. All three suspects were arrested in terms of the criminal matters amendment act and detained at Bishop Lavis Saps. Prasa technicians were called out to the site as the line was possibly out of service. The alleged thieves had inflicted terrible damage on the infrastructure and were it not for that anonymous call even more serious damage would have occurred. In total 800 meters of 33 kilo volt cable was recovered. The total damage to the infrastructure was estimated to be R272,708 excluding labour costs to repair the infrastructure. Cape Argus
