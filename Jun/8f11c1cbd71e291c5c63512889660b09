Human Settlements MEC Tertius Simmers said he was pleased with the steady progress that various housing development projects were making across Cape Town. Units of a high standard are being built and, the MEC said: “Green alternative building technologies have also been incorporated into these developments.” Simmers and departmental officials visited various sites, which include the Belhar CBD, Forest Village, Highbury Park, Penhill, Ithemba, Taiwan, Thabo Mbeki and Barcelona projects, to get a first-hand account of the headway that the projects are making. “Each of these projects are at various stages of completion and are expected to yield a combined total of 48 690 housing opportunities by 2022,” Simmers said. “I commend the department's officials and contractors who are working at a rapid pace to ensure that houses are delivered to the most vulnerable and needy in our communities. “However, despite our continued delivery, our backlog continues to grow in the face of an increasing population and a shrinking budget. It is therefore critical that we focus are finding innovative and creative ways to make our budget stretch further. “Over the next few weeks, I will be visiting more sites across the province and engage with communities to monitor progress.” mwangi.githahu@inl.co.za Cape Argus
