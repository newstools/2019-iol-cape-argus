Cape Town - The City of Cape Town on Tuesday advised on temporary road closures in the central business district to accommodate the State of the Nation Address (SONA) to be held in Parliament on Thursday. Richard Coleman, spokesman for Cape Town Traffic Services said the national government and the South African Police Service (SAPS) have requested that extended road closures be effected in the city from 6am until midnight, to accommodate the official opening of the 6th Parliament by President Cyril Ramaphosa.
