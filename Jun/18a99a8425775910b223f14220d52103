The Community Policing Forums (CPF) in Mitchells Plain, Lentegeur, Phillips, Strandfontein, Athlone, Steenberg, Lansdowne and Grassy Park are due to meet today at Athlone police station, to discuss the carnage. This comes in the wake of the murder of a police officer who was fatally wounded when suspects opened fire at a police vehicle in Lavender Hill, on Monday night. Police spokesperson André Traut said two officers of the Steenberg crime-prevention unit approached five suspects in Lavender Hill. “The suspects opened fire on the police vehicle in Grindel Crescent, and wounded the driver, a 34-year-old sergeant. The mortally wounded policeman was taken to hospital where he later died. His partner, a constable, escaped unharmed. “The provincial police management expressed condolences to the family and colleagues of the two policemen, and assured them that every endeavour would be made to apprehend the gunmen,” he said. Smith said the incident happened on the same night that he attended a gathering for the late Ignatius van Rooyen of the Milnerton Ridge Neighbourhood Watch, who lost his life at the weekend when he was shot by suspected hijackers, while on patrol in Montague Gardens. * Anyone with information can contact their nearest police station, Crime Stop on 0860010111 or SMS Crimeline 32211. sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
