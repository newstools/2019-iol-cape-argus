This could lead to a disruption of their education. To counteract this disruption, Tygerberg Hospital offers a unique opportunity for children to continue their education through the Tygerberg Hospital School. The school’s offering for children and adolescents with cancer was revealed yesterday during events to mark International Cancer Survivors Day. Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo said: “Looking after the ‘whole’ child is an important part of childhood cancer treatment, which is why continued education during treatment is a priority. These children still receive their education while in hospital.” Tygerberg Hospital School principal Zenobia Helm said: “All learners in Tygerberg Hospital are part of the school either coming to our school or are being taught at their beds.” “Currently there are 10 such learners in G3 oncology ward.” Meanwhile, Mbombo on Friday urged nurses in the province to display emotional intelligence in their quest to put the patient first while delivering safe and quality healthcare. Delivering the keynote address at the Western Cape College of Nursing’s International Nurses Day Celebration on Friday, Mbombo acknowledged the critical role nurses play in the public health system. mwangi.githahu@inl.co.za Cape Argus
