While there are no official statistics and no research, the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) said it had noticed an increase in the number of calls it receives for help. Sadag operations director Cassey Chambers said: “We’re concerned by the large increase in calls as we deal with more than 600 a day.” Chambers said mental illness affected the way one thought, felt, and behaved and needed proper treatment. Nosipho Waqu from Gugulethu Youth Council said mental illness had a social stigma, especially among black communities, “and it’s even worse when it’s someone young”. “Youth mental health and well- being needs urgent action by all organisations. Stress, trauma and environmental factors are creating increasing rates of depression, driving many to commit suicide or to substance abuse to escape.” mthuthuzeli.ntseku@inl.co.za Cape Argus
