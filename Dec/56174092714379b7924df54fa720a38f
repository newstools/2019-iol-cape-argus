Kay, attached to the Firearm, Liquor and Second Hand Goods Control Unit, was gunned down on November 14 outside his Bishop Lavis home while in his SAPS vehicle. Previously Kay’s niece, Kim Kay, said the family were comforted by the “richness and profoundness” of his work. “We haven’t really had time to mourn him because of all the arrangements leading to his funeral. He was a people’s person and being a police officer was the only thing he knew. “It was more than just a job for him. We are hoping that by the end of this month, the people behind this will be arrested. Knowing they are in prison will bring some kind of closure to the family,” she said. Hawks spokesperson Philani Nkwalase said: “The person that was taken in for questioning was cleared as he was not linked to the crime.” On November 29, a 23-year-old suspect was apprehended at Crete Close in Ravensmead. His fingerprints were apparently lifted from the SAPS vehicle on the day of the shooting. Investigators will probe allegations that Kay was part of an insurance scam in which gang leaders reportedly took out life insurance for gang members who were subsequently killed. A source close to the investigation said policy payouts were shared, but the deceased reportedly didn’t share two payouts. vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
