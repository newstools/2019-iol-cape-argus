A total of 1771 students were scheduled to graduate at this year’s summer ceremonies at the Sarah Baartman Hall on upper campus on December 12, 13 and 23. Six graduation ceremonies were scheduled over the three allocated days. They include the conferral of three honorary doctorates.

The chancellor is elected for a 10-year period by the electoral college, which is chaired by the president of convocation, and consists of 21 graduates or holders of diplomas, six academic staff, six administrative and support staff and six students, together with the president of convocation and the vice-chancellor. Philanthropist and entrepreneur, Dr Precious Moloi-Motsepe, will take over the reins as the university’s next chancellor on January 1.     shakirah.thebus@inl.co.za Cape Argus
