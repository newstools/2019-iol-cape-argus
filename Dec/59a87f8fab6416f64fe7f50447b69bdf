This comes after the commanding officer of 2 Military Hospital wrote to De Vos’s attorneys acknowledging “that wrong has been done by preventing De Vos from being signed off as a medical intern”. The intern curator, Rasid Ismail, together with the head of gynaecology, Elizabeth van Wyk, were responsible for taking this action at the beginning of 2017. The lawyers are also considering suing Ismail and Van Wyk in their personal capacities for compensation for the damages that their client has suffered. Lawyer Martus de Wet said: “De Vos was a medical intern at 2 Military Hospital, when he was suspended without a hearing from the gynaecology rotation for his views that the unborn child is a human being.” “De Vos’s internship was completed in June 2017, after which he was due to start his community service. But the doctors then refused to sign him off, effectively barring him starting his community service,” said De Wet. “De Vos was then charged with unprofessional conduct, and after more than two years of delays, the professional conduct committee of the Health Professions Council of South Africa on December 3 struck down two of the charges against the doctor and confirmed that the disciplinary hearing does not stop the hospital from signing De Vos off.” mwangi.githahu@inl.co.za Cape Argus
