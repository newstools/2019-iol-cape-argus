While there are no reported cases in the province, beef producers already struggling with cash flow due to the ongoing drought now have to contend with movement restrictions that curtail livestock trade during the busy festive season when demand peaks. This is the view of Gininda Masiza, the provincial Department of Agriculture’s head of veterinary services, who said: “Farmers in the province that are more than 1500km away from the infections have been subjected to the same movement restrictions as farmers in Limpopo.” In reaction to a recent outbreak of FMD, Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development Minister Thoko Didiza gazetted a national ban on the gathering of cloven-hoofed animals, including livestock auctions, shows and similar activities. The prevention measures have a drastic impact on commercial and developing producers, as well as the rest of the red meat value chain. About 1.2 million households own livestock and are affected by the prevention measures in terms of income and food security. This impacts on the rural economy as well. Asked why the ban on auctions and other livestock gatherings was necessary, Gerhard Schutte of the Red Meat Producers’ Organisation said the move would ensure that livestock were not smuggled from the affected provinces to other provinces. As to whether it was still safe to eat South African beef, Schutte said: “Yes it’s safe, foot and mouth disease has no impact on humans.” While beef prices have remained normal, the supply chain executive at Beefmaster Group, Roelie van Reenen said: “As long this virus is contained in the Limpopo area, it shouldn’t affect price. “We need to ensure that the meat industry remains profitable, a stable source of revenue and employment, as it greatly contributes to the economy. This starts with a healthy herd,” said Van Reenen. mwangi.githahu@inl.co.za Cape Argus
