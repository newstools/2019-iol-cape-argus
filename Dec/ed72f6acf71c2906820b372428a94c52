The toddler, who is believed to be just two years old, was rescued by a concerned resident who saw the girl walking on her own in Spoonbill Crescent on Sunday afternoon. Lucinda Evans, founder of Philisa Abafazi Bethu, says the woman contacted her for help and she went to collect the little girl, who was dressed in shorts and a vest. Lucinda says she was at a family braai when the woman called her and she left to fetch the child. “I estimated that she is about two years old and she could tell us her name.” A team of volunteers went to nearby informal settlements to look for the child’s parents, and made pleas on social media, but nobody came forward or reported a missing child. “She was all alone and anything could have happened to her. I contacted the Social Development Department and the social workers came to collect her on Monday,” adds Lucinda.   Social Development spokesperson, Esther Lewis, says the little girl has been placed with a registered safety parent. “A criminal case of abandonment against the parents or caregivers is being opened with SAPS. “The child is unharmed and in good health. “The social worker has 90 days to investigate the circumstances of the child and family.   “The Children’s Act stipulates that where the parents are missing, the department must place an advert in the newspaper urging the biological parents or family to contact the social worker. “The social worker will present the findings of their investigation to the court.” monique.duval@inl.co.za Daily Voice
