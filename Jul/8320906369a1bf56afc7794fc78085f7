“Residents should please keep an eye out for the awareness campaign posters placed along the roads where most of the migration movement takes place. “The posters mark the areas where motorists should be most vigilant to avoid killing these charismatic amphibians, particularly on rainy nights,” said Marian Nieuwoudt, the mayoral committee member for spatial planning and environment. The awareness campaign is co-ordinated through the Western Leopard Toad Conservation Committee which is a group representing the City of Cape Town Council, Sanbi, CapeNature, and SANParks, as well as area co-ordinators who are mainly Capetonians managing volunteer activities within a geographical area. “The volunteers taking part in these activities brave wind, rain and cold, and often speeding motorists as well, to ensure our toads migrate safely to their breeding ponds. “I want to thank these volunteers for contributing to the toads’ safe passage,” said Nieuwoudt. Most of the toads are killed while crossing our busy roads. Capetonians are urged to spare a thought for these small amphibious neighbours. “The migration usually lasts only for a week or so and the continued survival of this threatened species depends on our consideration,” said Nieuwoudt.
