Cape Argus readers came to the rescue of Tezihano Mnyatsa, to fulfil his dream of playing in the chess championships in India. Tezihano, of Leonsdale in Elsies River, was selected to take part in the Under-14 Commonwealth Chess Championships. Since the Cape Argus published the story, business people and even radio presenters opened their wallets and reached out to Tezihano. In just two days, he was able to raise more than R20000. The ward councillor of the area, Francesca Walker, said the Cape Argus story played a crucial role in highlighting Tezihanoâ€™s plight. Walker had been helping the family raise money for the trip. The family had been trying for months to raise enough money, selling food parcels and hosting small fund-raising events. They also cut down on their food expenditure just to put a little away every month. Initially Tezihano was supposed to leave for the tournament last Tuesday, but he was unable to raise enough money. The championship started on Sunday and will end on July 7. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
