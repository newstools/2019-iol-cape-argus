This was one of the main resolutions reached following talks between the Muslim Judicial Council (MJC), the SANDF and the legal representatives of Major Fatima Isaacs, 47. Isaacs was disciplined for wearing a headscarf under her beret. The forensic pathologist at 2 Military Hospital in Wynberg is facing disciplinary action for wearing a scarf under her beret, in accordance with her Islamic beliefs. She appeared before the Court of Military Justice at the Castle of Good Hope, where her case was postponed until next month. A joint statement issued yesterday said: “The parties have resolved to continue to work together in order to find a solution, which will address and resolve the issues related to this matter.”
