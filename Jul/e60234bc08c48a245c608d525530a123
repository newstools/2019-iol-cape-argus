Xolani Ntshinga, 24, from Idutywa in the Eastern Cape, received his National Diploma in civil engineering last year and is currently studying towards his BTech. “I’m really passionate about sustainability and that’s why I decided to specialise in urban engineering studies. In the future, I’d love to work as a solid waste manager in urban areas,” he said. Ntshinga first got involved with CPUT’s Green Campus Initiative (GCI), a student development initiative, in 2017. “GCI is all about educating and making students and staff members aware of environmental sustainability. There are about 60 students from the Bellville campus alone who are involved with the programme that focuses on campaigns around saving water and energy.” Ntshinga said he hoped to one day make use of low-cost items to solve bigger problems of climate change, poverty and overcrowding. “I feel very happy and grateful to have won this award and my mother, Nokuzola Ntshinga, is also very proud of me.” CPUT spokesperson Lauren Kansley said that Ntshinga led by example and his commitment to making CPUT and his environment better was commendable. kauthar.gool@inl.co.za Cape Argus
