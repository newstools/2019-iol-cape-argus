"I want to thank all the teams for their assistance, from the firefighters who were first on the scene, to the many others who are currently helping in various ways." Relief operations are currently still underway:   In the coming weeks, the first qualifying beneficiaries of the Masiphumelele Phase 4 housing project will receive their State-subsidised homes. This housing project will eventually provide 227 houses to qualifying beneficiaries from the area, including residents living in the wetlands. "In the meantime, we want to thank all roleplayers, including the community, who have been working with us to ensure that the affected site can be ready in the shortest time possible," Booi added.
