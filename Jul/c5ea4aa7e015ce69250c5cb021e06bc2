Gerrit Erasmus Burger, alias Dr Johannes Hattingh, briefly appeared before Magistrate Reaz Khan on charges of fraud in the Cape Town Magistrateâ€™s Court. Burger, who resides in Plettenberg Bay, faces charges of fraud to the tune of R25 million, and was not asked to plead. He intends pleading not guilty. The matter stems from an incident at Cape Gate Mall in Brackenfell on August 30 last year. According to court papers, he presented himself as a Dr Hattingh and allegedly applied for a R19 million loan at Standard Bank. In a similar incident committed on November 13 last year, he applied for a loan of R25million. It was the use of fraudulent documents that led to his arrest. Investigation by the Hawks Serious Crime Unit uncovered the two fraudulent applications with the same documents. He was released on R15000 bail on March 6. According to an affidavit, the accused, after completing his school career, completed a BProc degree at the University of Pretoria. The matter was postponed by Magistrate Khan to September 4 for Regional Court referral. vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
