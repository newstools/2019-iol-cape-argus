African News Agency photojournalist Tracey Adams used three various methods of public transport to travel from Retreat to Cape Town. Adams documented the trials and tribulations that many Cape Town commuters experience in her “Three ways to travel from Retreat to Cape Town, using public transport” video documentary series. I recently documented travelling from Retreat to Cape Town at peak hour over three days on a Metrorail train, then a Golden Arrow bus, followed by a minibus taxi. My aim was to determine which of these vehicles was the best option.
