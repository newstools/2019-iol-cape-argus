Cape Town - The arm-wrestling between the City and taxi association Codeta over the N2 Express MyCiTi bus service is headed for court. The service runs between Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain to the city centre. Brett Herron, the former Mayco member for transport and the GOOD party's general secretary, said: "For six weeks we have heard no plan and no alternative for the thousands of workers and learners who depend on this public transport. "I find the neglect of our residents by our City leadership shocking and outrageous heads should roll.” Mayco member for transport Felicity Purchase said: “The City and the stakeholders are still in negotiations. "Its an extremely lengthy legal process. At the moment we have difficulty with Codeta agreeing to national government's proposals.” She confirmed that fresh talks are expected to start this week. Codeta is a shareholder of the vehicle operating company (Voc). Initially they did not want to sign the new contract proposed by the City, but Codeta then decided to take them to court to interdict them from signing with the other two parties. There are three parties to the joint venture and Codeta alleges that the agreement favours Golden Arrow Bus Services. Codeta’s attorney, Barnabas Xulu, said: “We have been working very hard on this matter; what people are forgetting is that this is a business and it's affecting people's lives.” Codeta spokesperson Besethu Dungane said: “Purchase cannot blame Codeta, she must blame the City. Our demands are that we want a single operational budget, we don't want to be party to a contract that has other partnerships.” Cape Argus
