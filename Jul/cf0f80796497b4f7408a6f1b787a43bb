Chief Petty Officer Dudley Malgas, 59, has been responsible for firing the noon-day gun at the Lion Battery on Signal Hill since 1999. But Malgas will fire his last round on August 31 before he retires from the South African Navy. Having overseen more than 6 000 firings, Malgas said what he has enjoyed most about his job has been meeting people from all over the world as they come to see one of Cape Town’s oldest traditions, dating back to 1806. The gun fires sharply at noon every day, except for public holidays and Sundays. “Whenever I take photos with the people and I ask them where are you from and they say ‘from Japan, or from England, wherever’, I say, ‘today I am going to Japan, or to England, or wherever’. So I love to meet people and speak to people,” he said. There are two guns which are fired on alternate days, Malgas added, but both are loaded so that if one misfires the other can be manually triggered. Malgas hopes to start his own tourism company and continue doing what he enjoys most - working with people from all over the world. African News Agency (ANA)
