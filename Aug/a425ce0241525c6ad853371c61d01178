Cape Town - The City of Cape Town said on Monday its advisory panel on planning appeals had given the green light for four private sector developments in Philippi township, dismissing an appeal against them and paving the way for the construction of over 240 affordable housing units. In a statement, the council said the developments would be located between Strandfontein, Ottery and Boundary roads and would help create a well-defined edge between the urban zone and the rural area known Philippi Horticultural Area (PHA).
