CAPE TOWN - A school taxi driver has been fined, and his vehicle impounded after the City of Cape Town's Transport Enforcement Unit stopped the vehicle in Kuilsriver on Thursday morning. City of Cape Town Traffic Services spokesperson Richard Coleman said the VW microbus was stopped outside a primary school.
