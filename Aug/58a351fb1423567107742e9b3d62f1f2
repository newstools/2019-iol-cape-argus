The festival - organised by the Woman Zone - takes place on Friday and Saturday. “At our Women’s Humanity Walk, we’ll be walking from the Castle of Good Hope to Artscape,” said Woman Zone spokesperson Beryl Eichenberger. “Aim of this years’ event is the empowerment of people with disabilities and many people will take part in the women’s walk with their wheelchairs, with Artscape’s chief executive, Marlene le Roux, leading the way, even though she doesn’t normally use one.” Once at Artscape theatre, participants of the walk will be entertained by wheelchair dances, exhibitions and theatrical performances. There will also be workshops celebrating women and people with disabilities. “The walk is open to everyone, not only women, and organisations can bring their banners, T-shirts and posters.” There will also be a storytelling event at the Women’s Library in Artscape Theatre on Friday at 5.30pm. “On Saturday we’ll have a poetry writing workshop and will be inviting poets to also share their written works with us,” said Eichenberger.
