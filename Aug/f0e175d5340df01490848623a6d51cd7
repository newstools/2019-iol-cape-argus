Cape Town - While on a game drive at Djuma Game Reserve in Mpumalanga, which forms a part of the greater Kruger National Park, passengers got an unexpected adrenaline rush after a rhino charged at them. The video of the incident was captured while the passengers were driving away from the angered rhino, and has since been viewed over 2 million times since it was posted to the Latest Sightings - Kruger Facebook page on Thursday. Rian Boshoff tells LatestSightings.com the story: "We were on a drive with Taxan at Djuma and we were driving along a riverbed when this bull white rhino crossed the road. "He stood still right next to the road and we went past him to continue our leopard search. As we did that, the rhino suddenly charged. "And as you can imagine, the guide stepped on the gas and we were going around corners like madness," Boshoff said. "The guide decided to head for the bush by making a sharp right turn trying to throw him off guard because of their bad sight, but the Rhino just kept charging. "After all the chaos the guide informed us that it wasn’t the first time this bull charged him and he doesn’t know what the story is with this bull. It was chaos and if it wasn’t for the guide with the right experience it could have been much worse!"   Cape Argus
