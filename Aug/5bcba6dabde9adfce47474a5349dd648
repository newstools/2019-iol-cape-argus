Hence, cellphone applications such as WhatsApp are fast becoming the primary communication tool for clients, said Richard Gray, chief executive of Harcourts South Africa. “We’re seeing an increased demand by clients to communicate with our agents and staff in real-time, which has resulted in a growing expectancy for instant feedback.” Some agencies in the UK credit almost 80% of their deals to being finalised through WhatsApp and other social media communication platforms. “The integration and feeding of saved contacts and social media connections to a singular mobile device has propelled client service into the spotlight. Many of our agents are now introducing WhatsApp marketing plans into their mandate strategies,” Gray said. He added that applications like it are very user-friendly when sending media such as videos, photographs, and embedded links to enquiring clients. Property 360
