The UWC alumni are engaging with students through the Access to Success campaign, in which students are shown how to apply for bursaries and top-up loans to pay for fees. UWC alumni relations manager Niven Maree said: “The initiative is about ensuring that students have the necessary resources to complete their studies. Since the inception of the campaign an excess of 140 students have received varying degrees of support from the UWC Access to Success campaign. “Even with the funding changes that have occurred in higher education, financial pressure is still a major issue for many students.” The Access to Success Phonathon initiative allows students to call UWC alumni across South Africa for support. Maree said UWC alumni and professors were not always able to support students financially, but alumni were known to offer students internships in their businesses. More than R2.3 million had been raised since the start of the campaign, and they hoped to secure a further R1m through pledges. Maree said the office conducted intensive follow-ups to convert pledges into money that could provide UWC with the ability to offer greater support to a larger group of eligible students. sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za Cape Argus
