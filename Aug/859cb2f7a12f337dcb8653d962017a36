The youth unemployment rate could, however, decrease through entrepreneurship. Mayoral committee member for economic opportunities and asset management James Vos said young people should start considering entrepreneurship as a career instead of searching for work in a job market that already offers limited opportunities. “By choosing to be entrepreneurs, our youth will not only create jobs for themselves, but might even be able to create jobs for others and in this way reduce the rising level of unemployment,” he pointed out. The city’s recently launched business hub aims to grow the local economy and create new jobs by helping small to medium enterprises and local entrepreneurs succeed. The hub is the brainchild of the City of Cape Town’s enterprise and investment department. It is a walk-in centre for entrepreneurs and start-ups to make it easier for people to operate their enterprises in Cape Town. Vos said the business hub would help provide solutions for small businesses and entrepreneurs to become more competitive and resilient. “SMMEs are the lifeblood of cities and the engines that fuel economic growth,” he added.
