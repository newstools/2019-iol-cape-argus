During last year’s elections, the agenda for the day could not be completed because of heated debates between various parties contending for the position of chairperson and so Nhlapo automatically took over the position. This is according to Calvin Maseko, director of advancement at CPUT, which is the body that manages the alumni department. “The debates between alumni got very heated and took longer than Nhlapo had anticipated, so we had to adjourn without having chosen a convocation president,” he said. According to CPUT spokesperson Lauren Kansley, the meeting disintegrated because of feuding factions, and for that reason, the decision was taken to disband proceedings. “The vice-chancellor has gone to great pains to engage with alumni, past academics and staff members to encourage them to consider putting themselves up for election in convocation for 2019.” Kansley said that convocation was one of the largest stakeholders at CPUT and that election to the governing body gave you a seat on the university’s council, the most influential decision-making body. According to secretary-general for CPUT’s Student Representative Council Sihle Ngxabi, convocation elections can be improved with tighter security. “We really need this convocation because as students, we often feel like our voices are not being heard.” kauthar.gool@inl.co.za Cape Argus
