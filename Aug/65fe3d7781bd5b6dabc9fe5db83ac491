Lee-Shane Booysen beat 15 dancers from different provinces, with the regional qualifiers having taken place in Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg. The finals were held at Johannesburg’s Newtown Music Factory last Saturday. “This is a big moment for me, and I am excited to be the one heading to Paris to represent South Africa,” said Booysen. “A part of me still cannot believe I have won because I thought the competition at regional level was tough, but the finals were tougher.” Booysen will be accompanied by Teboho Diphehlo from Soweto, who won the first Red Bull Dance Your Style last year. “Congratulations to Lee-Shane, he deserved it and good luck to the other dancers who made it to the finals, they too did very well,” said Diphehlo. “We as dancers have different approaches when it comes to dancing; some do it for fun, others for healing, to tell stories or educate, but if you want to win Red Bull Dance Your Style, you have to impress the audience nothing more or less,” The world final for the competition will take place on October 12 at the Grande Halle de la Villette in Paris.
