Penny Youngleson, an award-winning Capetonian playwright wanted to incorporate a wide variety of perspectives and experiences. “The musical is quite a joyous celebration of the community in Camps Bay,” she said. The show stars a 17-year-old mixed-race girl named Zoe, who is trying to find a community. Through her experiences with other members of the cast and their tribulations, she tells the story of many South Africans who are still searching for their place in this country. Youngleson said the audience could expect to see situations they knew intimately or had seen on the news. She wanted to capture the essence of what was happening on the ground in Cape Town. The musical explores themes of mental illness, contemporary forced removals and seeking identity in a world with blurred lines. Although the musical works through these issues facing the city, it is done in a feel-good way. Youngleson described the work as a “dark comedy”. eKhaya runs from Thursday until Saturday at 5pm.
