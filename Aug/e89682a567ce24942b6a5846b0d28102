The match was moved to another venue following the stadium’s failure of the traction pitch test, as guided by Fifa standards. Cape Town Stadium chief executive Lesley de Reuck said that as per the stadium’s standard maintenance programme, the pitch was replaced, resulting in its unreadiness for Tuesday’s match. “Unfortunately, due to the less than ideal weather conditions which resulted in lower average temperatures, the growth of the grass was stunted. “This slower growth has resulted in the root system not knitting or binding as well as it should,” De Reuck said. “On Wednesday, Cape Town City chairperson John Comitis came to inspect the pitch together with senior club officials, and after close inspection we were all satisfied that the pitch would be match-ready by Tuesday. “Unfortunately, later during the day, the PSL’s Ronnie Schloss deemed the pitch to not be match-ready, based on a traction test that was conducted, which indicated that two spots on the Northern side of the pitch were below the 25Nm² (nanometre) measurement at the time,” he said. CTCFC spokesperson Julian Bailey said this caused massive inconvenience to the team as well as their fans. “This situation has caused us all to work extremely long hours and attend over 100 meetings in the process. It’s also done a massive amount of damage to our brand as a club. “We’ve spent years developing a certain image, we’ve spent countless hours maintaining that image, only for it to be torn apart by situations out of our control,” Bailey said. On social media, users have also been very critical of the move:                         mthuthuzeli.ntseku@inl.co.za Cape Argus
