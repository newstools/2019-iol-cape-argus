Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz criticised the small turnout, saying more people should have attended the march to hand over a memorandum to his office because the issues affected many more people than were at the protest. However, one of the protest organisers, Sebastian Peters, said those who took part were leaders who represented thousands of people, and should not be insulted by Fritz. “We demand a meeting with the minister of police, social development, and education, “said Petersen. He said violence in Cape Town and the Western Cape was out of control and the meetings should take place two weeks from the date of the handing in of the memorandum. Grade 11 Garden Commercial High school pupil Donay Maarman of Parkwood Estate said that she left home at 5.30am to get to a school far away from where she lives so she could feel safer. “I support every drive to address crime in our communities. As the youth, our involvement is vital as we are affected on many levels. We are tomorrow’s leaders and our input and opinion is vital,” she said. baliswa.ntlahla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
