CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Social Development MEC Sharna Fernandez on Tuesday welcomed the department’s progress in the roll-out of the R23 million sanitary dignity project to learners across the province. The programme will consider a maximum of 222 schools and approximately 90,000 learners for the project. In February, the provincial cabinet and provincial treasury identified social development as the responsible department for the implementation of the sanitary dignity implementation framework. MEC Fernandez and the head of department for social development were designated to take responsibility for the project and to establish the provincial sanitary dignity committee to oversee the implementation thereof. “In South Africa, menstrual hygiene and the inability of female learners to go to school when they are experiencing their periods is not just a sanitation issue, nor is it a physiological one. Rather, it is something that has wider socio-economic implications with historical connotations, given where this country has come from,” Fernandez said. According to the office, it was decided that the project should prioritise schools in rural areas and include special needs schools. “Although there is still so much more to be done, this project will go a long way to promoting the dignity of thousands of indigent female learners,” said Fernandez. Currently, the department is seeking to appoint a service provider that can supply and deliver sanitary pads in terms of the stipulated specifications drawn out in the bid documents, the department added.
