Sound Match was the sponsor for the StanceWars Show and Shine competition. Ali Ebrahim, manager at SoundMatch, said: â€œThe Show and Shine competition for many, was one of the highlights of the event. We saw more than 100 of the finest custom cars battling it out for trophies and the title of 1st place in various categories. These included Best Wheel, Paint, Static Suspension, Air Suspension, Classic, Audio Install, Japanese, German, Race Theme, Old School Ride, Engine Bay and the coveted Best of Show. He said every driver was interviewed and encouraged to describe what made his ride unique. He said there were many vehicles, each with its own custom modifications, which set them apart from one another. Ebrahim said that with such a huge selection of vehicles, each unique its own way, there was certain to be a vehicle or two that appealed to everyone at the show. The Winner of the competition was Zuheir Mowlana, with his custom yellow Toyota Quantum. He received a trophy, a R1000 Soundmatch voucher, a roof or bonnet wrap from Urban Sky and a voucher from Wheel Merchants. sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za Cape Argus
