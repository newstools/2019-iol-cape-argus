MacDonald was told he had colon cancer on September 25 last year, after he went for a biopsy. Colon cancer is cancer of the large intestine, which forms part of the digestive tract. MacDonald said that since being diagnosed, he began studying the causes and treatment of the disease. There was so much processed food being sold and people needed to be a lot more aware of what they were putting into their bodies, he said. People who are older are usually more prone to this type of cancer, but today, younger people are being diagnosed with the disease. “It has become very important for young people to check what they consume because most of the food is not natural and our immune systems are fighting something that our bodies are not used to,” he said. “We should be eating more organic foods but this is becoming more difficult, especially because processed and artificial foods are now so easily accessible.” MacDonald said people should go for regular screenings because colon cancer could strike at any age. “The cancer can start progressing to further stages until it becomes terminal, and this is why it is important to go for screenings if you detect something wrong with your body,” said MacDonald. March is colon cancer awareness month. sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za Cape Argus
