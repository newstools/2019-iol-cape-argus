Entries have been slow and convener Dr Elias Parker has urged Capetonians to get their entries in early. The entry fee is R40. The annual event sees thousands of Capetonians come out in support of various charities across the Cape Peninsula and is fun for the entire family. Main beneficiaries of the 2019 event are Pink Drive, the Red Cross Children’s Hospital Trust and Academia Library, along with the Nomzamo Nutritional Centre and the Manenberg People’s Centre. The Big Walk, now in its 19th year, will begin outside Cape Town Stadium and end at the Cape Town Track in Green Point. Free cooldrinks and prizes such as an overseas trip for two, tablets and bicycles will be on offer. The Big Walk 2019 presented by Double “O” includes a 10km walk, 5km walk, and a new addition to the event, an 8km fun run. The route finishes at the Green Point Track with live entertainment, food stalls and a prize-giving. Bring your ID and proof of entry with your five-digit number to the registration point. Cape Argus
