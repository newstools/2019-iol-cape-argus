Cape Town - On Friday, March 1, Law Enforcement officers on the Grand Parade in Cape Town were called to a shop in the Golden Acre Mall where they arrested a 37-year-old male for shoplifting. The man had allegedly taken 34 pairs of jeans and left without paying for it. In Rocklands Mitchells Plain, a 20-year-old male was arrested by Law Enforcement officers for possession of mandrax and tik. On March 3, a Law Enforcement Auxiliary officer, newly graduated, was called into action. A dispute in a local fast food shop in Victoria Road, Grassy Park had escalated to the point where the local Neighbourhood Watch were asked to intervene. The Auxiliary officer joined them and immediately noticed one of the protagonists in the shop reach for something in his pocket. Alert and immediately suspicious, the officer prevented him from retrieving the item from his pocket and then went about checking his pockets. An unlicensed 9mm Parabellum firearm, 2 magazines and 26 rounds of live ammunition was found on him. The suspect a 25-year-old from Lotus River was arrested and taken to Grassy Park SAPS to be charged. The quick action of the officer prevented a possible damaging shootout in a public place and resulted in another illegal firearm being taken out of circulation. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
