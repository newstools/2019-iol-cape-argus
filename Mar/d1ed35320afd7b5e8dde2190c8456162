Cape Town - A R150 million project to repair and reseal the R60 from the Nuy intersection near Worcester to Ashton, and the R317 (MR287) from Robertson through Bonnievale up to the Cogmanskloof River bridge, is making good progress. The project started in October 2018 and is expected to be complete early in 2020. Work is being done in 3 to 4 km stretches, with half-width closures and stop/ go controls. Motorists can expect to have to wait a maximum of 15 minutes at stop/ go control points. The following operations will be undertaken:   The Department of Transport and Public Works (DTPW) said it is aware that delays are frustrating, but some inconvenience during construction is inevitable. Motorists will soon be able to enjoy a safer and more pleasant travelling experience on this road. DTPW is committed to creating short-term employment and skills training opportunities. During the course of this project, a total of R45 million will be spent on targeted enterprises, and 25 000 person-days of work will be created for people from the Langeberg Municipality area. The high-quality road infrastructure that DTPW provides is an important component of a safe and effective transport system, and an enabler of economic and social development in the Western Cape.
