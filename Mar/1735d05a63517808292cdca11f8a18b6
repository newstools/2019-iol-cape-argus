Cape Town - Bonteheuwel Ward councillor Angus McKenzie raised the alarm about the possibility of a foetus having been discovered in a drain nearby Bonteheuwel Day Hospital, but after SAPS was called in, the body was revealed to be that of a dog. When SAPS was first contacted for comment, Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed that police were present at the scene. "This office cannot confirm that a fetus was found in a drain and the identity cannot be confirmed at this stage. The SAPS members were present at the scene, the object is in the sewage drain deep down with the naked eye. At this moment it is difficult to confirm whether is it a baby or any other form of creature. "SAPS divers are present in the scene and busy arranging some equipment to bring the object to the surface and the ambulance was also in no position to confirm whether is it a fetus or not." After SAPS concluded their investigation, Rwexana confirmed that the body found in Bonteheuwel was not a foetus. "It was later discovered it is a dog that was in the drain." argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
