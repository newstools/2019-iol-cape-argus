The approach could spell the end of potholes, create jobs and help save the planet. It is estimated that up to 1.8 million plastic bags can be used in just a 1km stretch of road. The first phase will take place in about a month’s time when a large amount of waste plastic is expected to be imported from Scotland and will be used in the first pilot project. The trial will make use of 1.8 tons of non-recyclable plastic per kilometre and will include a complete reconstruction of Woltemade and Koraal streets in Chandler Bay. The term “plastic road” refers to replacing a significant amount of bitumen mix (made from crude oil) with waste plastic. It has been done in Bahrain, Australia, Canada, the US, Saudi Arabia and the UK. In the Eastern Cape there is an estimated R105billion backlog in road maintenance. Horatio Hendricks, mayor of Kouga Municipality said: “The backlog in road repairs for our region is estimated to be more than R500 million. While Kouga is strong financially, we simply do not have the rates base to deal with this backlog decisively.” African News Agency (ANA)
