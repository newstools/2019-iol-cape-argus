Advocate Sheriff Mohammed used the word during his cross-examination of a State witness and director of the centre Bernadine Bachar. Bachar was testifying in aggravation of a sentence where she highlighted domestic abuse statistics as well as services rendered by the centre to communities. Acting Judge Holderness said: “It is regrettable that you continue to use “inmate” when referring to survivors of domestic violence and abuse after I brought it to your attention before. “We will adjourn now and hope you take the time to think about your line of questioning.” Mohammed’s client, Simbarashe, was convicted of the murder of Nikita Lewis, 24. Lewis was seeking refuge at the centre, in Manenberg, when she was stabbed 34 times by Simbarashe. She had been living at the centre for just over a month when Simbarashe killed her on October 9, 2015. Nikita, two other women and four minors from the centre had gone shopping to Pick & Save Superette that day, when Simbarashe entered the shop and attacked her. Bachar said the province wasn’t winning the fight against gender-based violence. “We are calling for the harshest punishment to send the message that such a high number of women can’t be killed.” Sentencing proceedings continue. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
