Cape Town - Three men were caught illegally dumping multiple bags of rotten meat on Tuesday, revealed Mayco member for Safety and Security, JP Smith. "At approximately 18h20 on Tuesday, while patrolling Blikkiesdorp, we noticed a white bakkie standing on an open field," Smith said. "At first we thought it was an abandoned vehicle, but as we approached the vehicle we noticed that three males were busy dumping goods from the bakkie. We noticed the goods they were dumping was in fact old rotten meat packed in transparent bags. "We then requested assistance from the Beacon Valley staff, and informed control that the vehicle will be impounded. The meat was placed back in the bakkie and the bakkie was taken to Ndabeni pound, where the driver was issued with a R5000 fine and an impoundment notice for the vehicle was also given to him," Smith said. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
