Markwell said she was in contact with her brother throughout the day since she heard the news of Gill’s disappearance that morning. She said her brother updated her on his search and she had told him to come to her home in Tokai. “He arrived at my house at around 7pm, we had supper and he spoke to his daughters on the phone. He left at around 9pm to head home, in case Gill went back home. “Soon after Rob left, Lorraine arrived. We spoke a bit and a message came through from Nicola (Rob’s daughter) about something happening at Diep River,” she said. Markwell said Packham was distressed, emotional and distraught. Meanwhile, former relief commander at Wynberg Police Station Christiaan Labuschagne told the court when he spoke to Rob, at around 5.30pm that same day, the accused appeared relaxed. Packham was at the Wynberg police station to file a missing person’s report and was assisted by Labuschagne. He said Packham was seated on the opposite side of the counter seeming relaxed and busy on his phone. “If my wife was missing, I wouldn’t be able to sit still and wait to be held,” said Labuschagne. Due to jurisdiction, Labuschagne said he advised Packham to report the case at the Diep River police station. Labuschagne said he gave him instructions of what he should tell police there as well as his details to give the officer at Diep River to help fast-track the investigation. The trial continues. zodidi.dano@inl.co.za Cape Argus
