Cape Town - On Thursday, March 14, at about 13:30 Law Enforcement Officers patrolling in Dagbreek Avenue Westridge Mitchell's Plain spotted a group of people running towards the Firestation. They were chasing 2 males who the officers were told had been involved in a business robbery and the officers immediately joined the chase. The officers and an off duty policeman managed to catch one suspect whom the policeman arrested. He was searched and R1280 in cash and a small hand gun was found on him. The other suspect had fled but he returned to help his partner. He fired at the officers and they once more gave chase. The suspect then threw his firearm onto a field but within a few metres the Law Enforcement officers caught him and placed him under arrest. The abandoned firearm was recovered on the field. Both suspects were arrested and taken to Mitchell's Plain SAPS. It was discovered they had also shot at the shop owner, whom they robbed in Westridge but luckily no one was struck by the bullet. Incriminating evidence was also uncovered on their cellphones of arrangements to harm people, which appears to be gang-related. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
