This is to align its name with its objectives and purpose. The Hope Exchange is a place where the homeless of Cape Town can go for assistance in order to help them improve their lives. Melissa de Smidt, office manager, said The Carpenters Shop was originally named after its main purpose of teaching homeless people carpentry to teach them skills, which could help them with finding employment. The time had come to review the name as the carpentry project had been shut down some time ago and the services to the homeless were now more comprehensive. The new name explains what they hope to achieve. The Hope Exchange has helped about 700 people so far this year. It also reached an accomplishment of helping more than 2200 homeless people last year with daily acts of generosity, clothing assistance, food parcels, clinic visits and assistance with reintegration into society and reuniting the homeless with family members. sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za Cape Argus
