Cape Town - The Department of Transport and Public Works has started a project to upgrade and add to facilities at Pelikan Park High School in Zeekoeivlei, and to ensure compliance with all statutory health and safety requirements. This R25 million project is expected to be completed in October 2019, if everything goes according to plan. The project is being implemented in phases to allow the school to remain fully operational during construction. All vandalised doors windows and ceilings will be replaced. A new hall, two physical training slabs and a sports field will be constructed. The project also includes repairs to concrete walkways and the replacement of all fibre cement walkways and rainwater goods on the property. Project specifications require the use of material that requires minimal maintenance to reduce overall long-term costs. The school currently provides accommodation for up to 900 learners. Its teaching facilities comprise 30 standard classrooms and several multi-purpose classrooms. A borehole will be drilled to reduce the municipal water requirements during the construction process and to irrigate the new sports field once the project is complete. The project will use labour-intensive methods which will provide a limited number of short-term employment as well as skills training opportunities for local people. A total of R1,3 million will be spent on local labour and suppliers of construction materials. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
