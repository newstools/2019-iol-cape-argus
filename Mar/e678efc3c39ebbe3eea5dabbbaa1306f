Race director Shafiek Faure said: “The biggest challenge (is) looking (for) an event date. We used to take that last weekend of February and March, but we've been pushed into the last week of April. "This brings a lot of logistics problems, as we are dealing with other entities such as Cape Town Stadium. "We also have to make sure we keep the ratepayers' association content.” The race also manages to give back to the community as some of the proceeds go towards beneficiaries, a few of which include the PinkDrive and Al-Ikhlaas Academia Library and Resource Centre. “We believe giving back is important; we don’t just talk the talk, but by getting involved in the Big Walk we are walking the walk - it is the right thing to do,” said Wholesun Bread spokesperson Shabodien Roomanay. The event will begin outside Cape Town Stadium on April 7 and end at the Cape Town Track. Free cooldrinks, exciting prizes (such as an overseas trip for two, tablets and bicycles) will be on offer. The entry fee is R40. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
