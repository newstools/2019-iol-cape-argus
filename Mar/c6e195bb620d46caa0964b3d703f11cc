At UCT, a programme was started by its department of social development last year to address the matter on campus. UCT spokesperson Thami Nkwanyane said its scheme is serving 600 lunches on UCT’s upper campus, the College of Music, Hiddingh campus and the Child Guidance Clinic. Nkwanyane said a Defy double-door fridge was donated from the Department of Social Development’s Strategic Fuel Fund (SFF). UWC spokesperson Nashira Davids said it has several programmes to address food security challenges on campus. She said these include the Student Nutrition and Wellness Project, Gender Equity Unit Food Programme, Ikamva Lethu Trust Fund, Project Making A Difference and UWC Fairy Godmother. Stellenbosch University spokesperson Martin Viljoen said it was establishing food banks on its campuses, as well as Move4Food campaigns. The Cape Peninsula University of Technology, however, currently has no dedicated feeding scheme. CPUT student activist Athenkosi Hashe said the feeding facilities and model used at UCT and other tertiary institutions should also be implemented to ensure that all students are fed. “This would not only assist the students but it would decrease a lot of acts committed by students, such as suicide attempts as a result of hunger and depression.” CPUT spokesperson Lauren Kansley confirmed the lack of a dedicated feeding scheme. sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
