Daniel and his family emigrated to the Netherlands from Cape Town at the end of last year, following his parents’ decision to move abroad for work purposes. The 12-year-old played for Ajax Cape Town after he was scouted while playing for Camps Bay FC U9 in 2016. Last year, Daniel was awarded the Ajax CT U13 “Player of the Year” award. Following his family’s move, Daniel played for FC Victoria 1893, one of the oldest amateur clubs based in the Netherlands. Over the past two months, he was given trials for, and was offered places with FC Utrecht and SBV Vitesse Academies, both Eredivisie clubs, competing in the Dutch top league. Daniel was also invited to trial with Ajax Amsterdam, and as from the 2019/ 2020 season, he will be an Ajax Amsterdam Academy player after accepting the offer from the prestigious Amsterdam-based Eredivisie club. Daniel will follow in the footsteps of Benni McCarthy, Steven Pienaar and Thulani Serero, with all three South Africans having previously represented both Ajax Cape Town and Ajax Amsterdam. “I am looking forward to the challenge, and will do my very best to make Cape Town and South Africa proud,” he said.
