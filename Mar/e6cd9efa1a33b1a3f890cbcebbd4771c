The accused was identified on CCTV footage by Van Rooyen’s son, Luke van Rooyen, who was a friend of his. The footage showed a young man dressed in a hoodie and sunglasses entering the property just after 11am and leaving 40 minutes later. In his plea explanation, he told the court he had been invited by the deceased to say goodbye to her before he left for a trip to China to teach English. Detailing events that led to the murder, Groenewald alleges he was defending himself from being sexually violated by the deceased. “She pressed her bosom in my back, I became uncomfortable. She grabbed me in a passionate embrace. I pushed her forcibly and she fell back on her knees and threatened to tell everyone that I assaulted her and wanted to have sex with her,” he said. Groenewald said he hit her twice on the head with a vase to get her away from him and then fled. zodidi.dano@inl.co.za Cape Argus
