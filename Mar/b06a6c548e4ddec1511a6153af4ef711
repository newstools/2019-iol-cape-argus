Cape Town - On Monday 18 March 2019,Â  Western Cape Human Settlements MEC, Bonginkosi Madikizela, handed over 20 houses to elderly residents in Blue Downs/Eerste River. The Blue Downs/Eerste River Infill Sites Housing Project consists of 184 Breaking New Ground (BNG) houses that are being implemented in phases. Construction of phase one with 119 houses commenced in July 2017 and the project is currently 82% complete. Construction of phase 2 with 65 units is complete. "About 48 homes will be dedicated to the group of people I'm talking about - those who are earning slightly too much to qualify for a free house, but too little to get a bond. So we are building an integrated community here," Madikizela said. The oldest beneficiary to receive a house from was 78-year-old Nontozini Matywatywa. This project will mainly benefit residents living in ward 16 and 108 respectively. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
