Smith said he was briefed by their Safety and Security Investigations Unit about a habitual criminal released by the police earlier this month. Smith said the suspect, 29, with gang affiliations, was wounded in a shoot-out with metro police officers in Hanover Park on March 2. “Officers had responded to a ShotSpotter alert when they came under fire,” Smith said. “He was found in possession of a firearm and ammunition and detained at Philippi police station after medical treatment.” Smith said the suspect was meant to appear in court on March 4, but he was not charged and got released from custody the following day as the 48-hour holding period had expired. “It is shocking that a suspect with at least 10 arrests and seven convictions in the last decade was let go in this instance, on a charge amounting to attempted murder and the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. Two convictions were for escaping from custody and robbery. “He should not be on the streets, yet there he is, still tormenting the community with his criminal curriculum vitae,” Smith said. Police said on Sunday that they would look into Smith’s complaint. sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
