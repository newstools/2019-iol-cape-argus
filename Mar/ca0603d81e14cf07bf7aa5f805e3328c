Cape Town - The efforts by SAPS to address the drug trade in this province have led to the arrest of a 42-year-old female who was apprehended in possession of 125.50kg of dagga in Kraaifontein. Kraaifontein SAPS members were busy with routine crime prevention patrols at around 02:00 on Tuesday morning when they spotted a suspicious Hyundai IX35. They gave chase but the vehicle was abandoned by the driver. They followed up information and found the driver at a house in Nkani Street, Wallacedene. The premises were searched and three big bags and three smaller bags containing dagga with a street value of more than R60 000.00 were discovered. The suspect was arrested and detained on charges of dealing in dagga. Later it was discovered that the suspect was previously convicted on a Kraaifontein case for dealing in drugs with a ten-year conviction currently suspended for five years. The suspect will appear in the Kuils River Magistrates Court once she has been charged. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
