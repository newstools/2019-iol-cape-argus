CAPE TOWN - Seven suspects are due to appear in the Athlone Magistrate's Court to face charges of hijacking, Western Cape police said on Tuesday. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut said the suspects were all arrested on Monday during patrols that were conducted in Nyanga and Browns Farm in Cape Town. He said five suspects, aged between 16 and 25, were arrested in Ntambanane Street in Lusaka, Nyanga, while driving in a silver Volkswagen Polo which was reported hijacked in February last year in Borchards Quarry. “An imitation firearm was also found in the vehicle. The other two suspects, aged 17 and 22, were arrested on the same day while driving a Black VW Polo in Bristol Road in Browns Farm. When tested it came out positively hijacked in Lansdowne earlier this month,” Traut said. In an unrelated incident, police arrested a 34-year-old man for the possession of an unlicensed firearm at a Cash Store in Debeza Street in Browns Farm. “Police received information about an unlicensed firearm kept at the address, they searched the premises and found the firearm, a black 7.65 with six rounds of ammunition,” added Traut.
