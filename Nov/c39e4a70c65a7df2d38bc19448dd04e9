The organistion was started in 2014 by Jantjie Booysen. It accommodates 15 men and provides a place to sleep, ablution facilities and meals. It also co-ordinates different personal and skills development programmes with the goal of alleviating poverty in communities that surround Blue Downs. Booysen said: “I worked for the City of Cape Town for 14 years as an assistant professional officer, working with people on the street, and so my passion for helping the homeless was born. I started the organisation in 2014, and roped in Abedah Lawson in 2015, because she was also doing community work and I felt that having her as part of the organisation would be beneficial to this venture.” Booysen said the NGO also provided fatherhood, teenage pregnancy, and substance abuse programmes to residents in need. “We also offer skills development programmes such as brick-laying and computer skills.” The Ubuntu Circle of Courage is in partnership with the City. Some of the people who are on the Expanded Public Works Programme, which offers short-term employment to residents as they carry out socially useful activities, stay at the shelter. “During winter we do not charge the homeless to stay with us, but during other seasons we charge them R700, which comes from their Expanded Public Works Programme income,” said Booysen. Lawson, who works in construction, and was a co-ordinator with the Local Network of Directors project - an initiative that aimed to prevent the use of drugs by young people - and a project manager at the trauma unit at Delft police station, said her passion for helping the homeless was born when she was a young girl. “Currently we can only assist 15 people, but we want to help so many others, so we are hoping to get a bigger place to accommodate more people and render more services,” she said. kauthar.gool@inl.co.za Cape Argus
