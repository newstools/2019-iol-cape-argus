The event on November 30 will correspond with national Disability Awareness Month, marked until December 3. For the first kilometre of the 5km walk, sighted people will be walking alongside the visually impaired, listening to their stories and learning about some of the challenges they face. “Before the race takes place, the sighted participants will go through an obstacle course at Rustenburg Girls High School while blindfolded, making use of a walking cane and being guided by the centre’s orientation and mobility specialists,” said Judith Coetzee, deputy chief executive and fund developer at CTSB. “While we still need to confirm everything that will be featured on our obstacle course, we do know for sure that we will have plastic traffic cones that sighted participants will be walking through while blindfolded and with a cane,” she said. Coetzee said the obstacle course would also feature a large object that represents a car and what the visually impaired have to go through when trying to navigate around badly parked vehicles. CTSB is a Salt River-based organisation that teaches visually impaired people basic computer literacy skills, barista skills, life skills and much more. “We also teach them how to weave bags and make furniture and they graduate at the end of November. So all in all we want to equip visually impaired people with entrepreneurship skills,” said Coetzee. Tickets for the walk are R100 at Quicket. All funds will go towards CTSB and visually impaired people and children under 12 can enter free. kauthar.gool@inl.co.za Cape Argus
