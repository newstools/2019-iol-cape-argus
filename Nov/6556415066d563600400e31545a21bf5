Packham argued that witnesses Paul Gray and Keenan Thomas erred in identifying him as the person who was at Diep River station on the evening of February 22, 2018. He also questioned the reliability of the National Photo Identification System (NPIS) used by SAPS in photo identification. Packham, serving 20-years in Brandvlei Prison for murdering his wife, Gill, in February and setting her car and body alight, said on his application: “Thomas was at the Diep River Station during the evening of February 22, 2018 and described a coloured male, light of complexion and approximately 30-35 years old. “Not a single image was presented to Thomas which even vaguely resembled the person he described in his affidavit. No coloured male was depicted in any of the images and no person of the age of 30-35 years was depicted in any of the images,” Packham said. On June 26, 2016, Packham’s leave to appeal the conviction was rejected by the Western Cape High Court. Back in May, Judge Elize Steyn described Constantia businessman Rob Packham as an "accomplished liar" who had led a double life and whose version of events was clearly fabricated before finding him guilty of his wife's murder and defeating the ends of justice. His wife Gill disappeared on February 22 last year. She did not arrive for work at the usual time of 7:30am and her body was later found in the boot of her burnt out BMW near the Diep River train station. Judge Steyn rejected Packham's version that she could have been the victim of a random hijacking and instead found that Packham was "a crafty deceiver", agreeing with the State that his conduct had been indicative of guilt. vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
