Committee of Caledon spokesperson Odwa Silimela, who is also the EFF’s secretary in the Overberg region, confirmed the details. “The families of the deceased have been informed and funeral arrangements are under way. Windvorgel will be buried on April 13 in Caledon and Matselebane will be laid to rest in Matatiele, Eastern Cape, during the Easter weekend,” he said Police spokesperson André Traut said the case had been handed to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate for a probe. Meanwhile, life in Caledon has returned to normal. “Kids are back at school, people are back to work and the community is currently erecting their shacks,” Silimela said. On Thursday, the people of Caledon marched to the Theewaterskloof municipal offices to hand over a memorandum of demands for proper housing, sanitation and service delivery. They gave municipal officials seven days to respond. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
