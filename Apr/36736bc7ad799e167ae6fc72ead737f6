Former premier and the ANC’s provincial head of elections, Ebrahim Rasool, flanked by provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs and acting provincial chairperson Khaya Magaxa, said early polls showed support for the ANC at 40%, 12 days to go before the polls. Rasool unveiled a pamphlet that the ANC will deliver to households in the province as a final call for people to put their trust not only in President Cyril Ramaphosa, but in the ANC in the Western Cape, he said. “The DA is struggling to keep its head above 50%. I think the game plan in this election the ANC followed has produced the kind of results in the Western Cape we wanted. It involved thousands of volunteers every weekend going door to door in 40 local election areas,” Rasool said. About suggestions of an ANC and EFF coalition, he said: “We are not in talks with parties about a coalition because we believe we will be able, in the remaining days, to get this powerful message out, that will bring the votes.” DA provincial campaign spokesperson Daylin Mitchell said: “This will be a close race and every vote will count.We urge voters to unite behind the DA to keep the ANC and EFF out of the Western Cape.”  vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
