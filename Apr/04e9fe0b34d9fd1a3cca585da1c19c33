“I have learnt about incidents of theft at three of our swimming pools in recent days that have caused thousands of rand in damages, and more importantly, resulted in the closure of the Retreat and Manenberg swimming pools,” Mayco member for community services and health, Zahid Badroodien, said on Sunday. Early on Thursday, March 28, thieves gained entry to the filtration plant room at Retreat and removed the steel pipes, gauges, and valves from the filter. This impacted directly on the operations of the facility as the infrastructure was key to maintaining the water quality of the swimming pool. “We will have a clearer idea in the next few days of the time frame for repairs, as well as the cost of damages,” Badroodien said. The Manenberg swimming pool had been closed for several days already after the power cables were stolen, he said. “We are also assessing the situation at the Parow North swimming pool, where a similar incident took place on or around Human Rights Day. Among the items stolen were a chlorinator, two booster pump motors, a dosing system, chlorine masks, PVC pipe, copper pipes and other fittings.” Anyone with information about these incidents should contact the SAPS or the city’s public emergency communication centre by dialling 0214807700 from a cellphone or 107 from a landline.
