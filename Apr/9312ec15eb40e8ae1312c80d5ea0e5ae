Cape Town - The Western Cape Veterinary Services in conjunction with South African Equine Health and Protocols (SAEHP) have focused efforts to enable equine exports from the province. As part of this drive, the Western Cape has instigated further control measures to ensure the integrity of the African Horse Sickness controlled areas. AHS is endemic to South Africa and the Western Cape control zones are of vital importance to protecting the province’s equine export market. Economic Opportunities MEC, Beverley Schäfer said: “The current movement restrictions into the Western Cape are an example of our successful control systems at work in protecting the integrity of our AHS controlled zones.” “By unlocking equine exports, we will be able to grow a valuable sector of our agricultural economy and ensure that the horse industry is able to grow and create more jobs in the province,” Schäfer said. The Western Cape Government in partnership with SAEHP and the national DAFF is committed to maintaining compliance with international disease control standards and creating a sustainable equine export market. “I appeal to all horse owners to comply with all the movement control regulations,” Schäfer said.
