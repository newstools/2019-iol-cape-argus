Cape Town - The South African National Parks (SANParks) had announced two of its field rangers, were attacked and injured by an elephant in the Kruger National Park (KNP) on Saturday, while conducting a routine patrol in the iconic park. According to Nhlanhla Themba, the KNP acting General Manager Communications, Alfred Maluleke and Bethuel Khoza are stationed in Pafuri in the north of the park, and were on their routine patrols when they had an encounter with an elephant. Themba said due to their skills and knowledge of wildlife behaviour they managed to escape with minor injuries. "The field rangers were rushed to a nearby hospital for observation and were later discharged," Themba said. The KNP Managing Executive Glenn Phillips said: "These are some of the many dangers that our rangers face on a daily basis, it is not only poachers that pose threat to our men and women in green." sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
