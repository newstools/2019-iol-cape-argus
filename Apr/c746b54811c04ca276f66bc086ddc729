Cape Town -Â While the Easter long weekend marks the last days of Lent, which many will celebrate, it also provides an opportunity for Cape residents to take some time out and enjoy a short holiday break away from home. "I want to urge all motorists, those travelling far, and those staying local, to please be extra mindful on the roads this coming weekend," said Mayor Dan Plato. "I want to appeal to all our residents to please exercise caution and to not drink and drive. Your actions could lead to the loss of life and should be something we try at all cost to avoid. "Our traffic, Metro Police, and Law Enforcement officers, will be out on the roads in their numbers to keep you safe and we make an appeal that you please work with us." Plato wished all those who will be indoors, an enjoyable break spending time with loved ones. "Have some Easter eggs, hot cross buns and pickled fish. Please keep a watchful eye on your families because it is our responsibility to make sure our little ones stay safe. "May you all have a blessed Easter." Cape Argus
