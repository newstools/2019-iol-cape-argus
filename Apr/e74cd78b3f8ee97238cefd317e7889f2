Cape Town - SANParks served the interdict application against a Cape man for allegedly trespassing on the National Parks and extracting water. This matter was brought to SANParks’ attention recently by concerned citizens, who provided documentary evidence of the allegations. Residents claim that there were up multiple vehicles that came to fill up with water when the Cape was in the middle of the drought. After the claims were made, SANParks followed due process as a custodian of Table Mountain National Park and conducted their own investigation into the matter. During the investigation, pipes were discovered on the National Park, which is now subject to legal proceedings. SANParks is in the process of instituting legal proceedings and thus cannot comment further on the matter. At this stage, SANParks officials are monitoring the situation carefully by ensuring that there are no illegal connection to draw water from the stream. The matter is expected to be heard on the 29th April 2019 at the Western Cape High Court. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
