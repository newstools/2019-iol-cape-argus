Cape Town -Â Four people were killed and three others left injured on Sunday night following a three-vehicle collision on the R45 near Franschhoek in the Western Cape. ER24 paramedics, along with Metro and Fire Services, arrived on the scene to find the smashed vehicles scattered in the road. On closer inspection, paramedics found two people lying motionless inside one of the vehicles. Assessments showed that both had sustained numerous fatal injuries. Nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead on the scene. In the second vehicle, paramedics found a critically injured man, a critically injured 5-year-old girl and two other patients with moderate injuries. Both the man and a woman lay trapped within the vehicle. Fire Services had to use specialized rescue tools to free the two trapped from the vehicle. Once freed, paramedics treated the patients and provided the two critically injured with advanced life support interventions. The patients were later transported to nearby hospitals for urgent care. Unfortunately, the critically injured man succumbed to his injuries on route to hospital while the young girl succumbed to her injuries in hospital. One other patient from the third vehicle was assessed and found to have sustained only minor injuries. The patient was treated and transported to a nearby hospital for further treatment. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
