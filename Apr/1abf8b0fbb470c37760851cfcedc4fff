Cape Town - The average water level for all dams in the Western Cape currently stands at 37.6% (2018: 17.6%). Dams supplying the City of Cape Town stand at an average of 49.8% (2018: 21.4%). Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC in the Western Cape, Anton Bredell says the average dam level in the Gouritz River Catchment area – which encompasses large parts of the drought-stricken Karoo - is currently 21.8% “The situation in the Karoo remains concerning and we continue to monitor and provide assistance across the entire region. There is rainfall projected for the province but according to the SA Weather Services, the data does appear to indicate late winter rainfall,” Bredell said. Bredell has continued to call upon consumers to use water wisely and responsibly. Major Dam statistics   Cape Argus
