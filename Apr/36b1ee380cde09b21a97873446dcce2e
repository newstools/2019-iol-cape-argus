According to Deidre Adams, spokesperson for the Suurbraak Farmers Production Support Unit, hundreds of small-scale farmers in Suurbraak, Barrydale, Swellendam and Buffelsjag, and subsistence farmers who grow food crops in their backyards, would benefit. The beneficiaries received equipment to the value of R7million. “We welcome this investment. It is time that we build a relationship, so that our subsistence farmers can start to flourish. We see this initiative as something that could alleviate poverty and create economic opportunities,” Adams said. Phuti Mabelebele, spokesperson for Skwatsha, said: “The hand over of the equipment is part of the department's programme directed at improving living standards and alleviating poverty.” The department's Vuyani Nkasayi said the initiative is aimed at bolstering rural industries in areas with economic development and forms part of on-going efforts to support emerging farmers. He added that the equipment is part of the programme on Rural Development Enterprise and Industrial Development. vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
