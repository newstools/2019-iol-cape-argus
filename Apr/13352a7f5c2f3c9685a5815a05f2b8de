A (bone marrow) blood stem cell donor drive will be held at the Mosque in Goodwood Street on Saturday, April 6 from 12.30 to 16.30. Everyone between 18 and 45 years old with a BMI of less than 40 and a consistent weight of more than 50kg is invited to register. A blood stem cell transplant follows a procedure where a person's defective cells in their bone marrow are replaced by healthy ones. The chance of finding a match is 1:100000 and the best chance is within your same ethnic background. There is only a 25% chance that a sibling will be a match. Patients of colour and mixed ethnicity around the world are at a disadvantage due to the under-representation of black, coloured, Indian and Asian donors in the global donor pool. “Any form of organ donation that does not involve death of the donor is permissible. This includes bone marrow stem cell donation and blood transfusions,” said Sheikh Ebrahiem Tofa, head of community and member of the Muslim Judicial Council.
