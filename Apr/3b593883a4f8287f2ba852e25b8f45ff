Cape Town - Social Development MEC, Albert Fritz, together with the Economic Development MEC, Beverley Schäfer, and Councillor Cynthia Clayton will be visiting the Lesedi Skills Academy (LSA) based in the heart of the Atlantis Special Economic Zone (SEZ) on Friday. LSA provides skills development and training, allowing young people to enter the formal job market. It further supports the industrialisation of Atlantis which was declared a SEZ in 2018. Since 2015, LSA has trained over 100 learners, mostly from Atlantis. Of those trained, 92% are 35 years and younger. The visit to the Atlantis SEX comes after Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel raised his concerns while visiting the area on Monday. At the notorious Dura Flats, Patel saw first-hand how residents lived in the rundown buildings. Patel said: “For the enormous millions of millions of rand of tax benefits that the SEZ will bring we need an educated workforce, it needs people living in decent conditions and we won't realise the promise of jobs if the problems of Atlantis are not solved. “I'm very concerned at the lack of sufficient attention to development. If we don't get local skills, it means the SEZ can't take off or we need to import skills from outside, which would lead to resentment from local communities." argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
