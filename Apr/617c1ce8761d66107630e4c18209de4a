The exhibition, from Friday to Sunday at the Castle of Good Hope, is expected to attract thousands of people from across Cape Town. Spice Mecca chief executive and event brand ambassador, Shreef Abbas, said: “The fight for freedom and justice will be a strong theme at this year’s event to coincide with the country’s celebration of 25 years of democracy on April 27. While the exhibition will showcase the best in culinary and consumer offerings, it will also celebrate South Africa’s 25-year milestone through a series of fascinating exhibitions and public events.” The event will be shown on DStv’s ITV channel 347 and broadcast on Voice of the Cape radio on 91.3fm. This year’s sponsors are Standard Bank, Awqaf South Africa and Legend Tours. “This event belongs to the people of Cape Town,” said Abbas, who urged the broader community to attend. Tickets are R35 for adults, R20 for pensioners, no charge for children younger than 12. Early birds can look forward to a weekend pass at R75. “This event is about breaking down racial, cultural and religious barriers. We have infused the spirit of freedom into the entire exhibition.” mthuthuzeli.ntseku@inl.co.za Cape Argus
