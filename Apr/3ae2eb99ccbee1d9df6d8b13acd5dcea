Cape Town - The average dam level in the Western Cape has dropped to below 34.8% (2018: 16.6%). Dams supplying the City of Cape Town stand at an average of 46.4% (2018: 20.5%). Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC in the Western Cape, Anton Bredell says the situation remains as predicted ahead of the winter season. “We have been getting some rain across large parts of the province in recent weeks but not enough to make a meaningful difference just yet. We are expecting more rain in the coming weeks and months as the regular winter rainfall period kicks in.” Bredell has cautioned communities across the province to be proactive and to prepare for the colder and wetter months to come. “In addition, the public is advised to contact their closest disaster management centre as quickly as possible should an emergency occur. The easiest number to remember to call in an emergency is 112,” he said. In case of emergency other relevant numbers to call are:  Major Dam statistics
