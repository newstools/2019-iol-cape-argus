Cape Town journalist and independent documentary filmmaker Yazeed Kamaldien is expected to showcase his work-in-progress documentary film at various screenings. The first screening took place on Sunday at the Labia cinema in Cape Town. “I spent time filming this on my iPhone and I am very happy with the turn out. We have politicians and film-makers here. I am proud of the turn out,” Kamaldien said. He has spent the past few months following De Lille during her time as mayor of Cape Town and after her departure from the post and the DA, and the formation of her new political party Good. Kamaldien will follow her on the election campaign trail before the polls on May 8. The documentary shows the high tension De Lille experienced and what she calls the “abusive relationship” she had with the DA. Kamaldien interviews some of De Lille’s close allies such as her staff and councillors, who resigned in support of her. The film also looks at De Lille’s public image. Kamaldien said he would like to hear the DA’s version of events.   marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
