The area was approached and the suspect was spotted and searched. The 28-year-old man was found in possession of 59 dagga sticks and 38 Mandrax tablets. He was arrested and will be charged with dealing in drugs. A short while later, at around 11pm, members of the same unit reacted on a tip-off that a firearm was stored at a Village Heights residence. The house was searched and an unlicensed 7.65 pistol with eight rounds of ammunition was discovered. “Three male suspects, aged 18, 18 and 19, and two female suspects, aged 21 and 22, were arrested. Once charged, they will make a court appearance in Muizenberg to face a charge of possession of an unlicensed firearm.
