There will be more than 150 local and international stalls selling a wide variety of goods. All of the proceeds will be given to various charities which strive to make positive changes in the community. “We need to break down the cultural, religious and racial backgrounds that prevents us from being one. “The Ramadaan expo is about uniting our community,” said Spice Mecca chief executive Shreef Abass. “The entire programme is way beyond where it started a few years ago. It has become much more comprehensive. “Ramadaan for All is about sharing, embracing different cultures and also empowering local entrepreneurs,” Abass added. There will also be a freedom symposium on Freedom Day during the exhibition. sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za Cape Argus
