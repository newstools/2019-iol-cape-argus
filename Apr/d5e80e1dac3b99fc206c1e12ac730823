CAPE TOWN - The alleged kingpin of a card cloning syndicate in Cape Town is in police custody and will remain behind bars awaiting his trial, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) in the Western Cape said on Wednesday. In a statement, the Hawks said Arthur Qedinda Dube, 38, was refused bail at the Muizenberg Magistrate's Court after appearing on charges of fraud on Tuesday. He was traced to Johannesburg in March after detectives linked him to various fraudulent transactions in various areas around Cape Town. "Dube was on the run at the time of his arrest, he appeared at the Hillbrow court and the case was transferred to the Muizenberg court, culminating in his appearance yesterday where the hawks successfully opposed his bail bid," the Hawks statement said. Dube appeared alongside his alleged co-accused, Silindilizwe Ntini, 40, and Lwazi Madonono, 30, who are are both out on bail. "Ntini was arrested soon after a fraudulent incident at Vangate Mall, Cape Town, in October 2017 and further investigations led to the arrest of Madonono in May 2018," the statement said. "A stack of cloned cards linked to the trio that were reportedly used at various Cape Town Malls between 24 September and 3 October 2017 were seized." The case was transferred to the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Bellville where the trio will appear again on April 26. African News Agency (ANA)
