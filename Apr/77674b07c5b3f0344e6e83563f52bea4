Siboniso Thwala, 13, was selected to participate at the Dallas Cup, known as the oldest and most prestigious international youth football tournament in the US. Siboniso is a Grade 7 pupil at SPARK Lynedoch school in Stellenbosch. The tournament will mark its 40th anniversary this year. In a recent announcement, it was confirmed that renowned English club Liverpool will also compete. Mary Busschau of SPARK schools said: “The SPARK community is thrilled with Siboniso’s achievement. He is a hugely talented sportsman and all-rounder and this is a dream come true for him. One day we hope to see him play for Bafana Bafana." Siboniso’s family and friends in Khayelitsha are helping to raise funds for his trip and have raised half of the R30 000 needed.
