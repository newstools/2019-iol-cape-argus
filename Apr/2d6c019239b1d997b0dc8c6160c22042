Cape Town - Cape Town is honoured to host the world-renowned Old Mutual Two Oceans Marathon (OMTOM) said Mayor Dan Plato as it celebrates its 50th anniversary. "We welcome the nearly 30 000 professional athletes and running enthusiasts from 80 countries who will be taking part in the half and ultra-marathon in this special edition of the event," Plato said. "Events such as the OMTOM are a major boost for the local tourism industry, which currently employs an estimated 150 000 people with potential for further growth." The City’s long-standing partnership with the race is set to continue as the City of Cape Town has extended its sponsorship until 2021. "Cape Town is the World’s Leading Festival and Events Destination and events such as these serve to confirm our ability to host major gatherings and tournaments. "Sporting events provide fantastic recreational opportunities for our residents and create a significant amount of revenue for the city and province," Plato said. "I am sure runners and spectators will once again have an enjoyable and rewarding experience. We express our gratitude to the organisers and wish them well with an incredible event." Cape Argus
