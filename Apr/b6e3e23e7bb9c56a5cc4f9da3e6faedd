Cape Town - The Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation Unit together with the Western Cape  Department of Transport and Public works have arrested yet another suspect for fraudulent roadworthy certificate. The 36-year-old suspect, former cashier at a vehicle testing station in Jeffreys Bay, was allegedly linked to the capturing of applications onto NaTIS system. These applications were for Western Cape vehicles, allegedly issued with roadworthy certificates without ever being present at the said vehicle testing station for examination. Her arrest comes after four other suspects were previously arrested in Jeffreys Bay, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town on 12 and 13 March 2019. She is expected to appear at Vredenburg Magistrates Court on 25 April (today), together with four others who were each granted R2000 bail on 14 March 2019 by the same court. Meanwhile in a similar matter, the Grabouw trio, Abdi Mohamed Omar (41), Isse Abdulahi Mohamed (32) and Abdullahi Yuseg Ali (31) arrested on 17 April were each granted R1500 bail when they appeared at the Bellville Magistrates court on April 18. They are expected to be back in the same court on the 4th of June 2019. More arrests can be expected on both cases pending the on-going investigations. Cape Argus
