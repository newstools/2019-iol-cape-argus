During National Science Week, the university’s Service Learning and Civic Engagement units, partnering with marketing and communications company, Camissa Solutions, visited Beaufort West, Laignsburg, Mossel Bay, George and Vredenburg to introduce schools to the different career paths that can be followed through science and technology. “National Science Week is an annual Department of Science and Technology, National Research Foundation and South African Agency for Science and Technology Agency initiative. This year the theme was focused on the harsh realities of climate change,” said Jacqui Scheepers, CPUT manager of Service Learning. CPUT has now been invited by Camissa Solutions to extend the project to three more schools in Mossel Bay. “Despite the challenging circumstances experienced by some rural learners, science week opened their minds and broadened their horizons to what is possible,” said Lovetta Bolters, a representative of Camissa. “Bringing the university to towns gives youth alternatives for careers in science, technology and engineering that they may not have been exposed to before,” Scheepers said. kauthar.gool@inl.co.za Cape Argus
