Stuart Grobbelaar, communications manager for governance at the office of the municipal manager, said: “Our traffic department co-operated with the department of transport and public works, Home Affairs (Immigration), crime intelligence and Stellenbosch SAPS to score a major victory against the fraudsters.” The 10 had tried to apply for documentation at the municipality’s traffic and testing centre. Grobbelaar said: “On diverse dates since July this year, the 10 suspects visited the Driving Licence Testing Centre (DLTC) to apply for various documents. “Before the suspects could receive assistance, their visas had to be sent to the Department of Home Affairs for verification. Final verification confirmation was received by the DLTC indicating that (their) visa permits were not legally issued,” said Grobbelaar. A trap was laid and when one of the suspects returned to the traffic department to pursue his application, he was arrested. “Following his arrest, criminal cases were opened against the nine other individuals. Charges include fraud, being in possession of falsified visas and illegal entry into South Africa,” said Grobbelaar. mwangi.githahu@inl.co.za Cape Argus
