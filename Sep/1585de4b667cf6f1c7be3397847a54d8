Cape Town - Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has wished all members of the Jewish community in the Western Cape, a blessed New Year as they celebrate Rosh Hashanah. “Rosh Hashanah is one of the Jewish High Holy Days and is a special time of celebration for members of the Jewish faith, which will be celebrated until Tuesday. This is the beginning of a 10-day period of repentance which will end with the observance of Yom Kippur next week,” Winde said. “As part of the Rosh Hashanah tradition, members of the Jewish community undertake charitable acts and good deeds, which help to improve the lives of people living in the Western Cape. I wish them well over this special, holy period and thank them for their kind acts during this time.” “I hope that this is a time of celebration with family and friends. May you all be inscribed in the book of life and have a sweet New Year,” Winde said. Cape Argus
