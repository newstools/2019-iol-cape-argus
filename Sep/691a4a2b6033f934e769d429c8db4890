Cape Town - A touring bus caught fire before the N1 tunnel entrance in the Western Cape on Tuesday. Traffic chief Kenny Africa said the Paarl fire services, TOLCON fire and Drakenstein Farm Watch (DFW) fire teams responded to tackle the blaze. It is believed the fire started at the back of the bus, near the engine compartment. Africa said the fire destroyed the bus completely despite the joint efforts to kill the flames. "All passengers got out. First aiders and fire crew of the DFW were on site and slight injuries were reported. Some passengers complained about smoke inhalation," he said, adding that Paarl ambulance services were called out on the scene.  Africa said the cause of the fire was unknown. "No foul play is expected though". The fire caused a congestion coming out of the tunnel towards Cape Town. Africa said passengers were sitting on the side of the road and the fire has been extinguished. Sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
