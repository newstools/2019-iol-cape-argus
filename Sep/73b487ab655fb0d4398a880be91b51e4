Ecd4Asd - which currently has one centre in Retreat and one in Hout Bay - functions as a structured development centre where children with Down syndrome, autism, as well as other mental disorders can be assessed, with structured intellectual activities catering to each child. “We have very small classes, with one adult for every four children; that way these special needs children can get all the attention they need to learn and grow,” said Stevens, principal administrator of Ecd4Asd. “We specialise in special needs educational and developmental support services for children between the ages of 3 to 7 years old, monitoring the progress of individual children,” she said. Fraser, Ecd4Asd’s head of curriculum development and training said that the group was planning to open another branch in Fish Hoek. “We believe in a multidisciplinary team approach, learners will be assessed by an educational psychologist, a speech therapist and an occupational therapist on enrolment and therapy support will be provided,” she said. kauthar.gool@inl.co.za Cape Argus
