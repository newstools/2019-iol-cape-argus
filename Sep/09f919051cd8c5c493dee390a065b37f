The gathering of the various navy vessels took place in False Bay, overseen by the Chief of the SA navy, Mosiwa Hlongwane. “The SA Navy operates in dangerous and unforgiving environments and unfortunately lives have been lost in defence of our country.

Navy fleet flag officer Bravo Mhlana said: “It’s clear that the limited funding had an impact on the fleet and its ability to conduct its primary role of offering welfare. Despite this, the navy fleet has still continued to fulfil their missions even with the little we receive. The displaying of the ceremony today represents the hard work of our people.” The different SA navy vessels sailed past the SAS Protea as part of its ceremony, while the SA Navy chief stood at the edge, saluting them. The capabilities of the navy being portrayed would provide an overview to officials on how the navy armed forces can be strengthened. Hlongwane said that establishing a SA National Defence Force had been a challenge. However, SA Navy had made significant strides in setting an example for representing a “rainbow navy”. In about two weeks, the navy will unveil a new name for the Naval Base at Simon’s Town that will highlight the commemorative events of the maritime service in support of 25 years of democracy in South Africa. A memorial service to acknowledge the SA Navy sailors who lost their lives while on duty takes place this morning at Fleet Command Headquarters. sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za Cape Argus
