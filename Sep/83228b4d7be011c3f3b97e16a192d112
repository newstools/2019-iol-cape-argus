Cape Town - Fast-action from one individual helped saved the life of a colleague who had clutched onto their chest before they fell over. It was the co-worker's first aid skills which played a big role in helping save a man's life on Tuesday. Ross Campbell,Â ER24 Spokesperson said: "A 56-year-old man who collapsed at his workplace in Parow Industria this morning is fortunate to be alive thanks to the Designated First Aider who initiated CPR (Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation)." ER24 paramedics arrived at the factory at 8:55 am on Tuesday to find the man unresponsive. "They were informed that he had clutched his chest just before collapsing and that the First Aider had been administering CPR for 10 minutes. Our medics were able to successfully resuscitate the man with the use of a defibrillator, rushing him to Tygerberg Hospital for further treatment," Campbell said. "Our paramedics said that it was the patient's quick thinking co-worker's who called the Emergency Services and initiated CPR straight away that saved his life." Cape Argus
