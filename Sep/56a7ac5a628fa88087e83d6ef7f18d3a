Cape Town - Fourteen people were left injured on Tuesday morning, two of them critically, when a bakkie and light delivery vehicle collided head-on on the Dassenberg Road in Atlantis in the Western Cape. ER24 paramedics, along with the Atlantis Fire, Life Healthcare and the Western Cape Medical Services, arrived on the scene before 08h00 to find a bakkie and a light delivery vehicle on the side of the road. On closer inspection, the Fire and Rescue Services had already extricated three patients that had been trapped and were busy extricating the fourth patient. On assessment, medics found that a man and woman had both sustained critical injuries while twelve others had sustained minor to serious injuries. The patients were treated for their injuries, and the critically injured provided with advanced life support interventions, before the critically injured woman was airlifted by a private medical helicopter to a nearby hospital. The remaining patients were transported by ambulances to nearby hospitals. The details surrounding this incident are not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
