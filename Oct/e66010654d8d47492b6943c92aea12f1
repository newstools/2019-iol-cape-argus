 We are outraged and talking too much because Baleka Mbete's performance was in front of the world and, is a reflection of South Africa's political leadership.   Even President Ramaphosa himself was also shocked by the fact that Baleka Mbete does'nt know anything about #MarikaMassacre pic.twitter.com/gimX3Q3AhD   Unless @MbeteBaleka insisted on that interview with @mehdirhasan she should fire her whole team! That interview did not do her any favours. If you saw Baleka Mbete TownHall with @KarimaBrown in 2017 you would know why she should have NOT done that interview   The facts are nothing new. But when @mehdirhasan lays them out, #BalekaMbete is exposed as a shameless sell-out. @MYANC can stop pretending #StateCapture was a surprise. This schizophrenic game of being victim, perpetrator & saviour is quite tiresome. https://t.co/7TAubxsZ9a   Baleka Mbete goes all the way to UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ to say she will find out about Marikana murderers.What is it for her to find out when she really knows that no one was jailed for murder. #AljazeeraInterview   when ppl ask you if you know baleka mbete after seeing that al jazeera interview pic.twitter.com/bMsR8MIYgk   Baleka Mbete should've turned that embarrassing interview down. Just when we thought we had recovered from 2016 Maite Nkoana-Mashabane's Al Jazeera equally embarrassing interview, boom, Baleka outshines her.   Baleka Mbete should be burned from doing any media interviews. She is embarrassing, this shows how our politicians are, she thought it's our paid journalist that giggle with you when they interview. This is how our journalist should be conducting interviews #BalekaMbete #ANC pic.twitter.com/hP4uzr4bkb   If you didn't vote for the party of which Baleka Mbete is a senior representative, then you don't have to feel embarrassed. If you did, you do.   Baleka Mbete is embarrassing, she must stay away from Media ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” https://t.co/0inXkbshvF
