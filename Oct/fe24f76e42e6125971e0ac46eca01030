The sentence was meted out by Judge Lister Nuku in the Western Cape High Court on Thursday. Jordaan also received 10 years imprisonment for rape. Judge Nuku said Jordaan had showed no remorse and elected to remain silent, and the reason for the murder had remained a mystery. “Not only did the accused rob the deceased of her dignity by raping her, he also murdered her cold-bloodedly for no apparent reason. He committed a heinous crime that can only be described as callous. This crime was premeditated and the accused took Cilliers to a secluded spot, where she was killed,” the judge said. Cilliers was raped and murdered on Long Lands Farm in Stellenbosch in 2007. The post-mortem report showed that she had been strangled and hit consistently on her head with a blunt object. Initially, Jordaan pleaded not guilty and denied ever having sexual intercourse with her, but changed his tune after prosecutor Mbulelo Koti confronted him with DNA results linking him to the crime. During aggravation of sentence, Koti argued that the accused had previous convictions involving violent crimes against women and hence had the propensity to repeat these crimes. The State also argued that Felicity's 14-month baby, who died two months after the incident, had grieved to death. Cilliers's father Johannes, 65, said: “I've waited for this day for 12 years. It is such a relief. I'm very sick and believe after watching him being sent to prison that I will get better and get on with my life.” Felicity's sister, Dalene Cilliers, 33, said: “I hate Jordaan for what he did to my sister.” vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
