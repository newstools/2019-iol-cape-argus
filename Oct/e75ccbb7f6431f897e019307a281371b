Mayco member for Safety and Security, JP Smith, said this year, the City has made nearly R3 million available to support neighbourhood watches. He said the R2 938 700 budget included equipment, training and support. “Our neighbourhood watches increase the reach of the City’s policing services. They are our eyes and ears when they patrol their suburbs and ensure a visible presence and security in communities they serve,” Smith said. He said members were not only able to prevent crime with their presence, but they were often the first responders to crimes. “It’s essential we equip them with knowledge on how to address the everyday crime concerns of residents, such as domestic violence, abandoned cars, vacant plots filled with trash, and drugs and gang activity,” Smith said. “Neighbourhood watches assist law enforcement teams by alerting police to suspicious activity, identifying stolen property, doing home security surveys, and building a sense of responsibility in the community.” Smith said they were committed to helping neighbourhood watches become functional, accountable and capable partners in the fight against crime. “The City’s Safety and Security Directorate is aware of the impact they make in their communities and commend them, and that’s why we provide watches with resources.” sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
