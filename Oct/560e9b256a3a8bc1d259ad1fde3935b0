“The additional facility, located at 30 Victoria Road, will be a fully operational clinic. Details of the services from the facility will be communicated at a later stage once everything is finalised,” said department spokesperson Natalie Watlington. “We want to assure the residents of Hout Bay that we are committed to continue to provide health services to the entire community. We will also continue to provide basic health services from the Hout Bay Main Road Clinic in Imizamo Yethu, the Hangberg Multipurpose Hall, and from Hout Bay Community Health Clinic in Hangberg.” To improve easier patient access, the department will also be boosting the service to communities directly through the collection of chronic medication and other community-based services. “We believe that these additions will ensure improved health services to residents,” said Watlington. Residents in Hout Bay were up in arms after the day hospital in Hangberg was closed on September 17 and only reopened in early October due to violent community protests that broke out in the area, making it difficult for staff members to gain access to the facility. Hout Bay community activist Roscoe Jacobs said that he had been informed by a member of the department that a polyclinic would be built in the area that would offer both primary and specialist healthcare options. kauthar.gool@inl.co.za Cape Argus
