Potelwa said 889 arrests for an array of crimes including murder, attempted murder, assault and robbery were carried out in the past two weeks. “Of the figure, 337 were wanted suspects.” Potelwa conceded the road ahead still required more than boots on the ground. She added from a dark period, “when in one weekend May 31 to June 2, a total of 73 murders were recorded provincially, followed by another shocker in July, when 13 murders occurred in 48 hours in Philippi East as well as other incidents, the situation has been stabilising and murders are now averaging the 30 per week, provincially”. She said it was testament to the hard work of the integrated forces as well as station, cluster/district and provincial deployments. “Figures aside, the absence of serious violent crimes incidents, particularly on weekends when crime often peaks was on its own an indication that the impact of the operational intervention is beginning to yield results.” Potelwa said: “The police in the Western Cape are cognisant of the president’s extension of the duration of the SA National Defence Force deployment in Cape Town, thereby taking Operation Lockdown to March 2020. As a consequence, all operations are still executed with vigour and strength.” Potelwa added that since July, integrated forces attached to Operation Lockdown were hard at work executing operations in the identified areas. Communities with vital information on crime are urged to call the Crime Stop number 086 001 0111. Cape Argus
