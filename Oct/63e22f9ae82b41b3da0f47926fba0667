Acting Judge AJ Hack also interdicted Isaac Kashama and 10 others from re-occupying Unit B and/or the entire property. The application in the Western Cape High Court was brought by the Western Cape government and the provincial Department of Transport and Public Works. According to the papers, the 11 initially entered the premises when a certain Etienne Dibwe and his family concluded a written lease agreement to conduct a steel work and panel beating business in unit B5 and 5(b). But when Dibwe died in May 2010, his brother Kashama continued to occupy unit B4. Letters of demand to vacate the property were sent, but the occupants failed to move. Hack said: “The bald denials of unlawful and criminal conduct by the respondents are rejected as untenable. I agree with the applicants submission that the respondents do have the necessary financial resources to obtain alternative accommodation.” vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
