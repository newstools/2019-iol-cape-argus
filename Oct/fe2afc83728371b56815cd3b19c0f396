Cape Town - The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) on Wednesday announced that it will take legal action against Springbok rugby player Eben Etzebeth, who is presently at the World Cup in Japan, over a complaint that he racially abused a person in Langebaan, Cape Town. The SAHRC said it received a complaint in August 2019 alleging that the Springbok rugby player, "physically and racially" abused the complainant in Langebaan during an altercation. In a terse statement the SAHRC said it was taking the matter to the Equality Court in Cape Town. "The SAHRC will institute legal proceedings against Mr. Eben Etzebeth in the Equality Court on Friday, 4 October 2019," said the statement. The rights body said it will hold a public meeting in Langebaan on Thursday evening, ahead of the court hearing, to "report back" on progress made in dealing with this complaint. Previous reports soon after the alleged incident said Etzebeth met with the SAHRC and "strongly denied" the allegations. â€œIt is completely untrue and unfouned to claim that I physically or racially abused anyone in Langebaan as has been reported on social media. Multiple witnesses can corroborate that," Etzebeth was quoted as saying. African News Agency (ANA)
