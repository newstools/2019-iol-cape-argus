Throughout the week, the HSFSA, the Department of Health and other groups will be working to drive stroke awareness to empower members of the public to recognise and respond appropriately in a stroke emergency. Carica Combrink, from the Angels Initiative, said: “People closest to us are the ‘first responders’ when a stroke occurs. If they can act with certainty and speed to secure emergency treatment, we can save many lives and reduce the severity of long-term disability.” The HSFSA says that for each minute a stroke goes untreated, a person loses about 1.9million neurons. Being able to recognise stroke symptoms quickly and going to your nearest emergency hospital is crucial. If you know how to spot stroke symptoms, you can get help faster, which can save a life and reduce disability.
