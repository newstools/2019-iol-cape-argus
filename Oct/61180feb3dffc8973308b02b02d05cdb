Cape Town - The City of Cape Town has said that despite most firefighters in the City only working from 8am to 4.30pm, five days a week since October 1, the Fire and Rescue Services have managed to handle incidents that took place at the weekend quite well. “On Sunday we had 15 stations open throughout the city and we were able to cope comfortably, staff and vehicles were shifted around to ensure coverage,” said the City’s director for safety and security, Richard Bosman. “The fire chief and senior staff, as well as staff from our training academy came in for duty,” he said. He said that various incidents took place across the City that required the fire stations to be on standby. “The City’s Fire and Rescue Services received 89 calls this weekend, which included 40 motor vehicle accidents, two rescues, four trauma incidents, one drowning, three medical incidents, two incidents involving transport, four fires in an informal settlement, five in an informal settlement, one in a storage area and one that occurred in a shop,” said Bosman. Since last week, firefighters across the City have vowed to only work five days a week until their demands for being paid overtime are met. “We are not striking, but are only working eight hours a day until we receive sufficient remuneration for our services,” said SA Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) spokesperson Dumisani Magagula. kauthar.gool@inl.co.za Cape Argus
