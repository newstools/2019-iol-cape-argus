Cape Town - Eskom has announced that due to continued pressure on the national grid, the power utility will implement Stage 4 load shedding from 13:00 until 22:00 on Monday. "Since this morning, we have unexpectedly lost six additional generating units which have put additional strain on the system," said Eskom in a statement. Load-shedding stages depend on the extent of the shortage of generation capacity to meet the country’s electricity demand, with stage 1 being the least serious, and stage 4 being the most serious. Stage 4 calls for 4000MW to be rotationally load shed nationwide. Outages generally last for about 2,5 hours. Due to technical issues there can be minor changes in the load-shedding area boundaries from time to time.
