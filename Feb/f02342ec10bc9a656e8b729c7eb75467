UCT condemns this incident as we would any safety and security incident involving staff or students on our campuses. "CPS has measures in place to ensure the safety of all staff and students on campus. These include uniformed staff patrolling the campus, and the appropriate equipment installed to enhance security. CPS operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, from six service centres on our campuses," Moholola said. "CPS has also been working closely with our neighbouring police stations to ask for the necessary resources to ensure that staff and students are able to come to and leave our campuses safely. "The devastating reality is that crime is a daily issue for too many South Africans and UCT is committed to working with the South African Police Services to address the daily realities of crime but also through our research how we can improve the many aspects related to safety and security."
