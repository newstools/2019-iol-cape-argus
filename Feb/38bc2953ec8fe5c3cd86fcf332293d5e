Cape Town - Former Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille has unveiled her newly formed political party’s manifesto. “It is the responsibility of leaders to reach out to the vast majority of people who are not racisit to make their voices heard,” De Lille said. De Lille streamed the manifesto launch on Facebook Live, saying this was her party's way of entering a new era.     “We as GOOD are behind the call for the cost of data to be reduced so that we can connect with the people,” she said. De Lille's movement is based on four key themes: spatial justice, social justice, economic justice and environmental justice.     “It is time for all GOOD people to step forward and join the leadership of GOOD in committing to act with courage - to call out privilege and to tackle racism, discrimination and poverty,” she said. De Lille also said the party would focus specifically on cities and townships.     “Urbanisation is a reality. The majority of people live in cities and towns and that’s where we should be pumping resources. What makes us unique is that the issue of spatial justice has not being tackled by any political party,” she said. The party’s general secretary Brett Herron said: “Towns and cities have to prepare for the masses. Every town and city has it own unique advantage and climate change impacts towns and cities.” De Lille will be announcing the leadership of the party later this week. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
