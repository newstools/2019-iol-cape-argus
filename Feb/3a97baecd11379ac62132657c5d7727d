Cape Town - Jobs search engine Adzuna has found that Cape Town is the city with the most job opportunities, with 14 023 jobs advertised on the site in January 2018. The finding is based on an analysis of 140 000 vacancies advertised over this period. Cape Town was also found to be the city with the highest average salary, and the Western Cape leads with the highest paying average salary of roughly R369 401 per year. Economic Opportunities MEC, Beverley Schäfer said: “StatsSA data has consistently shown us that the Western Cape leads the pack in terms of job creation. Even though it measures a short period, this Adzuna data shows that we’re also leading the pack in terms of job opportunities and salaries.” StatsSA 3rd quarter data for 2018 indicated that employment in the City of Cape Town grew by 3.9% year on year. More importantly, however, the number of unemployed declined by 38 000 over the same period. According to Adzuna, the sectors advertising the most amount of jobs across the country were IT, consultancy, technology, engineering and accounting and finance. “The Western Cape government has focused on growing tech skills and opportunities in the province as we want to position ourselves as a global tech hub. Last year, the Endeavour Insights report revealed that the Cape entrepreneurial tech sector is significantly more productive than other African cities, employing more than double the people of Lagos and Nairobi combined, with 450-550 entrepreneurial companies employing between 40 000 to 50 000 people,” MEC Schäfer said. The Western Cape is also home to a fast-growing financial services sector, which now employs nearly half a million people. “Data for the third quarter from StatsSA’s quarterly labour force survey indicated that the financial services sector grew by 32 000 jobs or 7.6% year on year,” Schäfer said. “Cape Town was also named the top financial centre in sub-Saharan Africa, overtaking Jhb in the Global Financial Centres Index last year. It was the first time Cape Town has been named in the report, and was 2018’s highest new global entry, entering the global list at number 38. “As the Western Cape Government, our number one goal has been to create an environment conducive to investment and job creation. Data like this, which shows that opportunities are being created, is proof that our hard work, to attract investment and grow the economy through strategies like Project Khulisa, is paying off.” Best cities to land a job City Advertised Vacancies (January 2018)Cape Town  14,023Johannesburg  13,657Pretoria  5,378Durban  3,316East Rand (Ekurhuleni)  2,778 Best paying cities in South Africa City Average Advertised Salary (January 2018)Cape Town  R374,173Johannesburg  R359,285Sandton  R358,728Centurion  R306,315Pretoria  R231,553 Best paying provinces in South Africa Province Average Advertised Salary (January 2018)National Average  R385,741Western Cape  R369,401Gauteng  R304,799Northern Cape  R303,008KwaZulu Natal  R254,881Limpopo  R254,434Eastern Cape  R230,303Mpumalanga  R219,460North West  R214,480Free State  R210,837 The full report can be viewed here. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
