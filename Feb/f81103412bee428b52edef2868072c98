 In light of the #SansSouci incident, we'd like to know from you: Are teachers adequately equipped to maintain discipline in their classrooms? @IOL   I think learners aren't equipped with the the proper manners that should be shown in class.Teachers are only humans and sometimes they get treated like dirt in classes. https://t.co/yva6xoythL   Are parents adequately equipped to maintain discipline in their homes and raise their children with respect? https://t.co/gYi7FWvc0W   I don't believe that the teachers get any support from the Department of Education.   And my teachers would never have slapped me across the face it's called RESTRAINT!   @TheCapeArgus I see a video today of a teacher smacking a student at sansoucci girls. Is this the right thing to, well it is time that teachers are heard loud and clear. Teachers are fed up of being disrespected. South Africa's education system needs to zoom in teacher wellbeing
