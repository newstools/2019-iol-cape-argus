Cape Town - Pride provides a platform for every part of Cape Town’s LGBT+ community (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans*, queer, questioning, intersex, non-binary, asexual, polysexual, genderqueer and gender variant people) to raise awareness of LGBT+ issues and campaign for the freedoms that will allow them to live their lives on a genuinely equal footing. Pride includes people of every race and faith, whether disabled or able-bodied and all sexualities and genders including lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, queer, questioning, intersex, trans*, genderqueer, gender variant or non-binary as well as straight and cis allies. While the annual parade is taking place on Saturday, March 2, Pride has expanded to include many events in the week leading up the parade. Events already started on February 22, and pride activities will continue to take place throughout this week: FEBRUARY 26 Bookcase 2 - Berta's Tues 18:30 · by Cape Town Pride Festival Berta's Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa  FEBRUARY 26 Morgan McMichaels Live at Zer021 Social Club Tues 19:30 Zer021 Social Club Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa  FEBRUARY 27 Faith Communities Unit Against Discrimination Wed 18:45 · by Cape Town Pride Festival Pride Shelter Trust Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa  FEBRUARY 28 Pride DIVAS Extravaganza Thu 20:00 Zer021 Social Club  MARCH 1 Pride Shabbat Fri 18:00 · by Cape Town Pride Festival Temple Israel Green Point Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa  MARCH 1 Pride Poetry Evening Fri 19:00 · by Cape Town Pride Festival The Social Bar Green Point  MARCH 1 #GirlConnect Friday: 1 March 2018 - BlackBox Fri 20:00 The Station On Bree  MARCH 2 Cape Town Pride Parade Sat 12:00 Prestwich St, Cape Town, 8001, South Africa  MARCH 2 Cape Town Pride Parade and Mardi Gras Sat 13:00 Reddam Field, Green Point Urban Park  MARCH 2 Cape Town Pride Festival with 4 TONS of FUN Sat 18:00 Reddam Field, Green Point Urban Park  MARCH 2 Official Pride Afterparty Sat 20:30 · by Cape Town Pride Festival TAU Cape Town  MARCH 3 Village Drinks - Pride Mixer 3 March 2019 Sun 16:00 The 41 Camps Bay, Western Cape, South Africa  MARCH 3 GoodhopeMCC Pride Service Sun 18:00 Good Hope MCC argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
