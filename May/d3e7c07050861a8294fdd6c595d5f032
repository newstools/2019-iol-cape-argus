Mayoral member for community services and health Zahid Badroodien joined 200 nurses from across the city in a walk through Parow North at the weekend. International Nurses Day is commemorated annually across the world on May 12, the anniversary of Florence Nightingale’s birth, to celebrate the contributions that nurses make to society. This year, the theme is “Nursing: the balance of mind, body and spirit.” Bradroodien said celebrating it would be an opportunity for the City to honour the nurses for their commitment and the service they provide. “Our nurses go the extra mile to achieve this. They serve their communities daily, under challenging circumstances, and continue to be a beacon of light despite the pressing public sector challenges. Nursing is the engine room of health services in the city as nurses are essential stakeholders to transform healthcare.” The City honoured five hard-working individuals playing a significant role in the nursing fraternity. Nomabali Makeleni, manager at Seawinds clinic; Flip Daniels, manager at Wallacedene clinic; Mari Grove, clinic manager at Netreg; Amila Latief, City’s health trainer; and Bukelwa Mbalane, co-ordinator for programme support. “Our nurses face many challenges and they are required to respond to the health needs of their clients. And for this dedication I salute them,” Bradroodien said. Caper Argus
