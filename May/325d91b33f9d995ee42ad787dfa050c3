Many basic requirements for a job include having a driving licence and there is a vast majority of young individuals who have not yet received theirs, due to various reasons. “The students of CPUT spend most of their time at school doing their academic work, which makes it difficult for them to do anything during their free time,” said Sipho Mokoena, SRC president. “We saw it pointless for a student to graduate with their Master's (cum laude) yet they don’t even have a mere learner’s licence. “We, as the SRC, wanted to close this gap and provide our students with the opportunity to obtain their driving licences simultaneously with their academic qualification,” said Mokoena. The SRC at CPUT will partner with the Traffic Department and Now Empowering Achievable Dreams (Nead), which is a community organisation that provides free driving licence classes. Nead will visit the campuses on a weekly basis and provide classes to all learners that have applied to the programme. “The SRC is also going to pay for all the costs, except for the photographs, so that will encourage students to seize the opportunity,” he said. The date for the official launch will be confirmed as the application process is still under way. sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za Cape Argus
