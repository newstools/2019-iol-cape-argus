Paulsen returned electronic devices last year which he received as perks while an MPL, but said he deleted all data off the laptop and loaded a new operating system. Paulsen was elected to the provincial legislature in May 2014 as the sole EFF MPL, but resigned a year later, opting to swop with the party’s Western Cape leader, Bernard Joseph, who took his seat, while Paulsen moved to the National Assembly. The DA-led legislature approached the Cape Town Central Police Station and requested the police investigate Paulsen’s “refusal or failure to return the property”. During a parliamentary question in 2016 by DA chief whip Mark Wiley to Community Safety MEC Dan Plato regarding the status of a police probe into the theft of a laptop from the provincial parliament by a former member of the provincial parliament, Plato informed the house the case had been withdrawn. There remains confusion over whether the laptop was stolen, but after Paulsen returned the laptop last year, he said the National Prosecuting Authority decided to still proceed with the case.
