Cape Town - The vigilance and quick response of three members attached to the Steenberg police station after they came under attack this morning led to the arrest of two suspects. At around 09:15 the members were busy with patrols in Sonata Street Steenberg when the occupants of a Mercedes Benz shot at the police vehicle, damaging the one fender. The police officers pursued the fleeing suspects who crashed their vehicle and fled further on foot. Their freedom was short lived as they both were arrested, and found to be in possession of a 9mm pistol and ammunition. Investigation revealed that the Mercedes Benz was reported stolen in Goodwood earlier this month. The two suspects, 27-years-old and 35-year-old, are due to make a court appearance in Wynberg on charges of attempted murder, possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition, possession of a stolen vehicle and malicious damage to property, once they have been charged.
