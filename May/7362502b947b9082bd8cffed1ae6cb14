CAPE TOWN - The Cape Town traffic service and metro police department arrested 122 people, impounded 82 vehicles and issued 2,523 fines over the past weekend, the City of Cape Town said on Monday. The City’s mayoral committee member for safety and security, JP Smith, said suspects were arrested for various transgressions including driving under the influence of alcohol, reckless and negligent driving, outstanding warrants and possession of dangerous weapons, among others. Smith said the suspects were arrested between Thursday and Sunday around the Cape metro. Officers also impounded 14 minibus and 68 sedan taxis during operations along Nelson Mandela Boulevard and in the Cape Town CBD, Sea Point, and the V&A Waterfront. “We have been engaging the Western Cape Government for the last decade to pass new legislation to ensure that we can do effective enforcement around taxi behaviour, as the current legislation makes it almost impossible for enforcement agencies to be effective,” said Smith in a statement. “Even though we write thousands of fines every month it has little impact on their behaviour. The only viable solution is to start impounding minibus taxis for traffic violations and the new provincial traffic legislation which will be passed in the upcoming months will do precisely that. This is testimony to the doggedness with which we have pursued finding an effective solution for this problem,” he added. African News Agency (ANA)
