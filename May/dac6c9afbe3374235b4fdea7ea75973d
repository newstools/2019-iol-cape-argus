Jihan Kaisi, a former journalist, humanitarian and an activist, delivered a keynote address at the Zeenatul Islam Masjid Hall in District Six, hosted by the African Muslims Agency. Kaisi said her humanitarian journey started 20 years ago after she was given an assignment about the lives of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. The African Muslims Agency, through the event, sought to bring about awareness on Syrian and Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. Kaisi said in her graduation year as a journalist she met a girl in Lebanon. “I asked her what they ate and her answer changed everything. “She said they drew food on white papers and imagine eating it. For the next three days I wasn't able to sleep.” Kaisi said there were 1.5million Syrian refugees in Lebanon living under dire circumstances. The influx of refugees due to the conflict include 35000 Lebanese returnees and more than 31000 Palestinian refugees from Syria. Kaisi said kids were most affected in the inhumane camps. African Muslims Agency director Imraan Choonar said: “We provide boreholes, clothing, blankets and food in Africa." mthuthuzeli.ntseku@inl.co.za Cape Argus
