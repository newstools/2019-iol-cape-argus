Cape Town - The City of Cape Town advises residents to familiarise themselves with the features and contents of a City employee identity card, as well as other indicators which authenticates City officials. Also, posing as a City official, or making use of the City’s name is a criminal offence. The City would like to remind residents that fraudsters often pose as City employees and target unsuspecting Capetonians as part of their scams. It was recently brought to the City’s attention that a member of the public approached a resident and offered to tar the owner’s driveway. The fraudster alleged to be a City employee by using the name of an actual City official and offered to do the work for a fee of R3 500 which the resident paid. The fraudsters used a printout of a City staff member’s details to identify themselves as ‘officials’. Due to the nature of this case, the City conducted an investigation to determine whether the City official mentioned, or any other City of Cape Town employee was involved in the tarring of a driveway at this private residence. It was found that the suspect was an imposter, also, that neither the description, nor the geographical area of work matched. The complainant was advised to report the matter to the South African Police Service and the City offered to assist as needed. Residents are urged to take note of the following:   Residents who are approached by officials can also call the City to verify the names of the staff members, if needed. When in doubt, residents should rather decline the offer for assistance. Remember to capture the registration number, type of vehicle, photo of the vehicle and the description of the suspected fraudsters if possible. * Incidents can be reported to the City’s call centre on 0860 103 089.
