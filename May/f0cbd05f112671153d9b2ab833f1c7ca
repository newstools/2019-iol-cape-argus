Both the prosecution and defence team agreed that the case should be heard by the Blue Downs Magistrates Court on May 23. Volkwyn is facing a charge of murder and kidnapping. On Monday, prosecutor Nathan Adriaanse told the court he was inundated with bail applications. He told the court he would not have enough time to complete Volkwynâ€™s application. The application was granted and Volkwyn is to be kept at Mfuleni Police Station holding cells. Orderick went missing on March 24. His body was found eight days later in a drain in Melton Rose, Kleinvlei. According to his mother Davideen Lucas, 28, she had left the toddler in the care of Volkwyn after she was attacked by community members for allegedly stealing a phone. She said when she returned for the child, Volkwyn said he had handed Orderick back to her. Last week, Volkwyn asked that he be moved to a single cell because other inmates were demanding that he performs sexual acts on them. zodidi.dano@inl.co.za Cape Argus
