These newly appointed supervisors will oversee the volunteers of the Law Enforcement Auxiliary Service (LEAS) programme. There is currently about 500 volunteers part of the programme which provides a leg up and further assistance to the SAPS in terms of eliminating crime within the city. “These LEAS inspectors are making an extraordinary difference in communities because they are out there everyday making drug arrests, firearm arrests, catching crowbar gangs and making busts with the marine unit and they initiate operations which is adding a lot of value to the law enforcement,” said JP Smith, mayoral committee member for safety and security. “SAPS has lost about 4500 police officers over the four years which showed a significant depreciation in numbers. We are not as substantial in numbers yet therefore this reserves programme fills up the numbers lost. “We are therefore trying to compensate with the reserve programme,” said Smith. City auxiliary law enforcement inspectorate is the only reserve service in South Africa that is run by a municipality. Smith says the reserve programme is an innovative idea that the city drove which hopefully will be spread across the country. About 700 new volunteers are expected to be recruited over the next 12 months. sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za Cape Argus
