Cape Town - The City of Cape Town’s Metro Police K9 Unit strutted its stuff in a ‘show-and-tell’ lesson for primary school learners, in Rio Grande Primary School, Manenberg. The drug awareness show is part and parcel of the duties of the furry officers and their handlers, with dozens of shows across the metro every year. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith, are joining learners and teachers for the display. Smith said their service animals are a menace to criminals, "but can also put their best paw forward when it comes to raising awareness and education". He said they are a hit among children and law-abiding adults, and play an integral role in relationship building between the Metro Police    department and members of the public.
