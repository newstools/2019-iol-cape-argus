Cape Town - Premier-Elect of the province Alan Winde wants all his would-be MECs to undergo lifestyle audits before being appointed. Winde was facing a tightrope in selecting his provincial cabinet by getting the gender and race balance right and also bringing in experience. Previously a community safety MEC, Winde was tight-lipped about his choice of the 10 new MECs, indicating only that he would reveal their names after his inauguration on May 22. In a short message shortly after the DA’s election victory in the province, Winde said: “Every person appointed to the Western Cape provincial cabinet will undergo a lifestyle audit before being appointed. “Yes, you need to maintain the experience but you also need some new blood.” Current MECs said it was business as usual and would perform their duties until the day prior to Winde’s inauguration. Social development MEC Albert Fritz said: “It’s Winde’s prerogative as to who he wants to appoint. Until that time I will be continuing with my duties as MEC.” DA Western Cape leader and Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela said the compiling of the cabinet remained the prerogative of Winde, but added that they would be providing input. “The good thing about Winde is that he always consults the leadership and we will definitely give our input,” Madikizela said. vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
