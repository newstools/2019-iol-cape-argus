Cape Town - The Zeenatul Islam Masjid, in Muir Street, District Six, has joined forces with non-profit organisation Muslim Hands in the Big Aid Convoy effort to send relief to millions of Syrian refugees. In Ramadan last year, South Africans assisted with filling containers of rice and flour that was sent to Syrian refugee camps. The plight of Syrians due to the conflict in that country has become more and more desperate. About 13.1 million people in Syria need humanitarian assistance. More than 5.6 million Syrians have fled their country as refugees, and another 6.2 million people are displaced within Syria. This Ramadan, for the second year running, South Africans have donated generously by filling 18 containers â€“ 8 from Cape Town, 4 from Durban and 6 from Johannesburg. Zeenatul Islam Masjid has been co-ordinating the Cape Town efforts and on Friday, after the Jumuah Prayers, the Trustees, the Imam and Shaikh Peck with the Jamaah of the mosque will be sending off the last container from the mosque in Muir Street.
