Tomorrow, Volkwyn will be applying for a bail application. On Tuesday, Blue Down’s Magistrate’s Court heard the State was charging Volkwyn with Orderick’s murder. Orderick went missing on March 24. His body was found eight days later in a drain in Melton Rose in Kleinvlei. According to his mother Davideen Lucas, 28, she left the toddler in the care of Volkwyn after she was attacked by community members for allegedly stealing a phone. She said when she returned for the child, Volkwyn said he had handed Orderick back to her. In court, an emotional Volkwyn sobbed. Through his lawyers, he asked that he be moved to a single cell because other inmates were demanding he perform sexual acts on them. In the previous court appearance, there was a clash between Volkwyn’s supporters and Lucas. Jonathan Alexander, who was called in for questioning with Volkwyn but released soon afterwards, said his friend was innocent and Lucas knew what had happened to her child. “I feel hurt because my friend is in jail for something he didn’t do. She (Lucas) is guilty. They must just free my sister (referring to Volkwyn),” he said. Outside court, Lucas said she feared the court hearing would end in fights. zodidi.dano@inl.co.za Cape Argus
