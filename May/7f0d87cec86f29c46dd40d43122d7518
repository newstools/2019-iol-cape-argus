Cape Town - Cape Town roads were chaotic on Tuesday as numerous instances of protest action interrupted traffic on Baden Powell Drive and Jakes Gerwel Drive. Due to protest action Jakes Gerwel Drive was closed between Morgenster and R300 both directions. Weltevreden Road was also closed between Morgenster and Varkensvlei. Highlands Drive fwas also closed from Fulham Road towards Jakes Gerwel. Approximately 100 people were involved in violent protesting action at the intersection of Baden Powell Drive and Swartklip Road in Khayelitsha.  Roads were blocked due to tyres being set alight in roadway. Baden Powell Drive was closed between Mew Way and Eisleben Road, and as a result traffic diverted through Khayelitsha. City of Cape Town Traffic Service's Richard Coleman later confirmed that Baden Powell Drive, and all other roads were reopened as protest action had ceased. In another matter earlier on Tuesday morning, Coleman revealed that a Golden Arrow Bus was petrol bombed on Jakes Gerwel, Northbound before R300, and resulted in some passengers getting injured. Golden Arrow spokesperson, Bronwen Dyke-Beyer confirmed the incident saying: "The bus did not ignite but a female passenger sustained burn injuries and three other passengers were also treated for minor injuries. Our officials are keeping a close eye on the situation, which remains volatile. We are also diverting our buses to avoid areas of concern." Cape Argus
